  <body>
<h1>MCS policies</h1>
<p>Policies describe the individual pieces of information that MCS needs to render 
  pages that match the devices used by a range of users.</p>
<p>By applying different policies, you can distinguish between 'device-specific' 
  and 'device-independent' information. This policy based separation enables quicker, 
  easier maintenance as well as rapid implementation.</p>
<p>You can target visual presentation elements such as page layouts and style 
  sheets at particular devices, and reuse them easily. You can administer a single 
  source, rather than having to programmatically generate a piece of logic for 
  each and every device, layout or mark-up combination. This also means that your 
  application can more easily support new devices and changes in visual presentation.</p>
<p>You describe a set of policies for your application by creating a workbench 
  project, and using the MCS policy editors to define combinations of:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Components</strong> that bind different types of resource to devices</li>
  <li><strong>Assets</strong> and their attributes</li>
  <li>Graphical <strong>layouts</strong> for different devices</li>
  <li>Stylistic <strong>themes</strong> for different devices</li>
  <li>New devices and custom <strong>device</strong> policies, and standard policy 
    values and identification patterns to suit any special requirements in your 
    organization</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the policy editors there are a number of supporting workbench 
  views.</p>
<h2>Policy names</h2>
