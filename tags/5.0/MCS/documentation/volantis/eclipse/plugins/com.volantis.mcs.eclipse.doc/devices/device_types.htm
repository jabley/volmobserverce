<h1>Device types</h1>
<p>The main types of device in MCS are displayed in a device tree under the root 
  Master device.</p>
<p>The range of devices in your repository will depend on the specific repository 
  that you have selected to view or edit. For example, the installation on your 
  system might be for mobile devices only, or you might be working with a custom 
  repository defined by your organization for specific user groups.</p>
<p>In a full repository the main types are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Internet-Appliance</li>
  <li>Kiosk</li>
  <li>Mobile</li>
  <li>TV</li>
  <li>PC</li>
  <li>Voice</li>
</ul>
<p>You can view the tree in the Device Repository editor, an Outline view, Layout 
  and Theme editors and in a workbench Device Repository view.</p>
