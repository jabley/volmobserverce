<h1>Dissecting panes</h1>
<p>You can use dissecting panes to ensure that the devices like mobile phones 
  can deal with fragments in a layout. You can include only one dissecting pane 
  per fragment.</p>
<h2>Shards</h2>
<p>MCS automatically splits up the content of a dissecting pane, and sends it 
  as one or more shards to a device. For devices for which there is no maximum 
  WML deck size, the entire content of the dissecting pane is sent in a single 
  shard. Essentially, the dissecting pane behaves exactly like a normal pane.</p>
<h2>Navigation links</h2>
<p>MCS also generates navigation links automatically, so users can move between 
  the shards. If a shard is the first shard, the link to the next shard is enabled. 
  If a shard is the last shard, the link to the previous shard is enabled. For 
  all other shards, both links are enabled. You can associate links with device 
  access keys, where protocols permit it.</p>
