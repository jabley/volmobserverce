      <p>At design time MCS users develop policies in an XML repository. These XML
         policies can  be used for runtime deployment, or they can be
         implemented within a set of tables in a relational database.</p>
      
         <p>If you already have a repository from a previous version
            of MCS, which you have migrated as described earlier in
            these installation instructions, you should carry out an
            update of your existing repository content. To do this
            follow the instructions given in the MCS
               <em>Administratorâ€™s Guide</em>.</p>
     
         <p>If you selected the XML repository type in the MCS
            installation wizard, MCS will be automatically
            configured to use the XML repository.</p>
     
     
         <p>If this is a new installation and you are creating a new
            repository, you will need to create the tables holding
            the repository information under a specific user. This
            involves:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>Setting up appropriate JDBC driver jar files for
                  database access</li>
            <li>Creating a new database user and tables</li>
         </ul>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Throughout this section, you should also refer to relevant
               documentation for your database.
         </div>
     
      
         <h2>Setting up JDBC driver jar files</h2>
         <p>If you are using a database to hold your repository, you
            will need to make sure that MCS can access any JDBC driver
            jar files correctly. You will need a <span class="code">CLASSPATH</span> environment
            variable entry for your database client, and copy the
            corresponding jar files to the
               <span class="filepath">MCS/[context_root]/WEB-INF/lib</span>
            directory. Check the database documentation for details.</p>
         <p>For example, if you are accessing Oracle from a windows
            machine, modify or setup a system environment variable
            called <span class="code">CLASSPATH</span> to reflect the location of the
            corresponding jar file such as <span class="code">C:\jdbcdrivers\classes1x.jar</span>. From a Linux machine , this might be <span class="code">/home/jdbcdrivers/classes1x.jar</span>.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The x in the filename will be another numerical digit. Refer to the valid filename in the <span class="filepath">%ORACLE_HOME\jdbc\lib</span> directory.</div>
         <p>If you are accessing DB2 from a windows
            machine, modify the <span class="code">CLASSPATH</span> to reflect the location of
            the corresponding jar files on your local machine as
            appropriate, for example <span class="code">C:\jdbcdrivers\db2java.jar</span> and <span class="code">C:\jdbcdrivers\db2jcc.jar</span>.</p>
         <p>You will also need to copy any jar files to the
               <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps/[context_root]/WEB-INF/lib</span>
            directory. This also makes sure they are included
            correctly for the setup of your application server.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using DB2, make sure that any jar files
               copied to <span class="filepath">WEB-INF/lib</span> directory
               are renamed to have an extension of <span class="filepath">.jar</span> rather than <span class="filepath">.zip</span>.</div>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you are using Weblogic 7 and an Oracle database,
               there may be a <span class="filepath">classes1x.zip</span> file
               under the <span class="filepath">weblogic/common/lib</span>
               or <span class="filepath">weblogic/server/lib</span> directories. If so, then move this file
               elsewhere so that the correct oracle JDBC driver file
               is picked up at runtime from the
                  <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps/[context_root]/WEB-INF/lib
               </span> directory which is deployed as a WebLogic
               application.</div>
      
      
         <h2>Creating a new database user</h2>
         <p>You will need to create a user with administrator
            privileges that matches the user and
            password you specified during installation. Both have
            default installation values of "mariner". These user and
            password values are also automatically set in the
               <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file.</p>
         <p>Refer to the appropriate documentation for your
            database and your database administrator to create an
            appropriate new user.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you create the tables under a different user to the
               name you specified during installation then you will
               need to change entries in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file that refer to
               the database user name and password (under your
               application server's <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps
                  /[context_root]/WEB-INF</span> directory ).
         </div>
      
      
         <h2>Creating new database tables</h2>
         <p>Specific example scripts to create or drop the repository
            tables are provided for DB2 and Microsoft SQLServer along
            with generic SQL92 versions for use by Oracle and other
            databases.</p>
         <p>Connect to the database as the user you have just created
            and run the appropriate version of one of following SQL
            scripts:</p>
         <p>
            <span class="command">create_vm_tables.sql</span> - sets up tables for
            use by a single database user</p>
         <p>For Oracle and other SQL92 databases, use the scripts
            under your installation in
               <span class="filepath">MCS/repository/jdbc-repository/sql92</span>
         </p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The directory
                  <span class="filepath">MCS/repository/jdbc-repository/oracle</span>
               contains an Oracle script for creating new user, and
               should not be used.</div>
         <p>For DB2, use the scripts under your installation in
               <span class="filepath">MCS/repository/jdbc-repository/db2</span>
         </p>
         <p>For Microsoft SQLServer, use the scripts under your
            installation in
               <span class="filepath">MCS/repository/jdbc-repository/mssql</span>
         </p>
      
      
         <h2>Importing XML policies into the database tables</h2>
         <p>You create the contents for the database tables by
            importing the XML policy files with the <span class="command">mcsImport</span> command. These policies could be from a migrated repository, or
            created with the policy editors that need to be
            deployed for database access at runtime. See <em>Importing and exporting repositories</em> for
            details of the command parameters.</p>
         
         <p>If you wish to import the policies and device repository
            to test the installation using the
            <span class="filepath">welcome.jsp</span> page , you can access the
            associated XML policy files created during the
            installation as follows.</p>
         <p>The policy files are under the
               <span class="filepath">/MCS/repository/xml-repository</span>
            directory. The <span class="filepath">devices.mdpr</span> file is
            under the
            <span class="filepath">/MCS/repository/device-repository</span>
            directory. Refer to the <em>MCS Administration Guide</em>
            for command line parameters.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: This stage is not needed if you chose an XML runtime
               repository during installation, as the MCS
               configuration file will be set up to automatically
               access the policies and devices file under the
                  <span class="filepath">xml-repository</span> and
                  <span class="filepath">device-repository
            </span>directories.</div>
