<h1>Viewing a device repository</h1>

<p>There are two ways to view the attributes of devices in a repository; one for 
  the repository associated with your project, and another for any repositories 
  that are imported into your project, but not currently associated with it.</p>

  Views</span>|<span class="command">Device Repository</span> to open a workbench 
  view on the repository.</p>
<p><span class="taskhead">To open an imported repository</span>:</p>
<p>Double click on an imported repository in the policy tree, or right click and 
  choose <span class="command">Open With</span>|<span class="command">Device Repository
