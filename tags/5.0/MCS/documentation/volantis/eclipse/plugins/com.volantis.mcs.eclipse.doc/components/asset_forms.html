<h1>Forms of asset</h1>
<p>Most assets are targeted at specific devices or device families. The major 
  exceptions are image and audio assets. These assets occur in two or three forms.</p>
<h2>Targeted assets</h2>
<p>Targeted assets are associated with a specific device. Text assets are an example of a targeted asset. Finding the most appropriate asset when the assets are targeted is relatively straightforward.</p>
<p>MCS searches the repository for an asset which is targeted at the device currently 
  in use. If no asset exists, MCS searches the parent of the current device. This 
  search up the hierarchy continues until either an asset, or the root of the 
  device tree, is found.</p>
<p>With image components, a second search for generic image assets is carried 
  out before fallback rules are applied.</p>
<p>If no asset has been found and the component supports fallback, the search 
  continues to try and find an asset that satisfies the fallback component. Some 
  components support multiple fallbacks, and in this case, each fallback is searched 
  in turn to attempt to find a suitable asset. </p>
<p>Finally, all assets can support an alternate text fallback. Once again, the 
  same process is followed in order to try and find a suitable asset.</p>
<h2>Generic assets</h2>
<p>Generic assets cater for assets that are not targeted, and are appropriate 
  in situations where (for example) the task of identifying images for particular 
  devices ahead of time is very time consuming. The approach is to find the asset 
  that is the best fit at run time</p>
<h2>Untargeted assets</h2>
<p>Untargeted assets are not associated with a specific device, so finding the 
  most appropriate asset can be quite complex.</p>
<p>MCS searches for an asset with properties that make it suitable. For audio assets, for example, the decision is based on how the audio data is encoded. With images, encoding, pixel depth, rendering and image size are all used.</p>
