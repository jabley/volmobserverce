<h1>Layout editor</h1>
<p>The Layout editor has two pages, an Overview page listing the device layouts 
  and their general attributes, and a Design page where you can view your layout.</p>
<p>Along with the Layout editor Design page, you also work with two views, an 
  Outline view of the layout, and a Format Attributes view. When you make a selection 
  in either the design page or the Outline view, the other view or page is synchronized.</p>
<h2>Device layouts</h2>
<p>On the Overview page you can add or delete devices at any time. The devices 
  you select are listed in the Device Layouts section of the page.</p>
<p> When you add devices, you can browse the device repository and choose several 
  devices using the <span class="command">Browse</span> button in the Device Layouts 
  section.</p>
<h2>Device layout attributes</h2>
<p>In the Device Layout Attributes section you can set values for the selected 
  layout attributes.</p>
