<h1>Theme editor</h1>
<p>The Theme editor has two pages, an Overview page listing the device themes 
  and their general attributes, and a Design page where you can specify your style 
  selectors and define style properties.</p>
<h2>Device themes</h2>
<p>You can add or delete devices at any time. When you add devices you can browse 
  the device repository and choose one or more devices using either of the <span class="command">Browse</span> 
  buttons. </p>
<p>In the Device Layout Attributes section you can set values for some of the 
  theme attributes.</p>
<h2>Selectors</h2>
<p>On the Design page, you can define the style rules for a device theme. Style 
  rules have a selector and a set of style properties that define the page theme.</p>
<h2>Style properties</h2>
<p>You can choose style categories or sub-categories for the current selection 
  in the Selectors section from the category tree.</p>
<p>When you make a selection in the tree, you can edit the property values. The 
  number and type of edit controls depend on the category you have selected.</p>
