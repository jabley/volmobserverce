      <h1>Administering MCS</h1>
		
      <p>Multi-Channel Server (MCS) requires a minimum of maintenance once it is installed. However, there are a number of tasks which you will have to carry out from time to time.</p>
		
      <p>During your use of MCS you may need to perform some tuning by modifying the MCS configuration file. 
		</p>
		
      <p>You will need to  maintain your device repository by downloading device policy updates from the device update service. You will also need to manage the JDBC repository (or repositories) by performing import and export of policies. 
		</p>
		
      <p>Also, you will need to be able to perform other maintenance tasks such as cache flushes available from the MCS Server Manager.</p>
		
			
      <h2>Security</h2>
			
      <p>You must ensure that your repository is fully and properly backed up prior to any maintenance work. It is the responsibility of the user to ensure that adequate backup procedures are put into place.</p>
		
		
			
      <h2>Maintaining device information</h2>
			
      <p>The MCS repository contains information about devices stored as device policies. This information is used by MCS when generating pages tailored to the requesting device. As new devices are constantly being brought to the market by manufacturers, this information is kept continuously up-to-date. In order to refresh the device information in your own repositories you will need to perform a regular update using the update service.</p>
			
      <p>To update a device repository you use the Device Repository wizard to download an new XML repository version from the update service. A command line utility is also available. See <em>Device repository update service</em> and <em>Device repository update CLI</em> for details.</p>
			
      <p>To update device information in a JDBC repository, you import the XML device repository using the CLI import command <span class="code">mcsImport</span>. 
			</p>
