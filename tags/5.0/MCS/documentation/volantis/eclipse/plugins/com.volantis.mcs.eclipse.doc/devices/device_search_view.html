      <h1>Search view</h1>
      
      <p> The Search view is a workbench feature that you can use to
         locate a wide range of information in your project files. MCS
         makes use of the general search features to help you quickly
         locate device information in the Device Repository. When you
         open the Search dialog you can use the Device Search tab to
         enter the search details.</p>
      
      <p>You can search for devices by name or for values in both
         primary and secondary device patterns, using either the
            <span class="uicontrol">Device name</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Device
            patterns</span> options.</p>

      </p>
      
         
      <h2>Search syntax</h2>
         
      <p>The search string that you enter can contain wildcard
            characters. You use <span class="code">*</span> for any string, for
            example <span class="code">*/UAProfile/*</span> will return all
            patterns containing /UAProfile/. You can also use
            <span class="code">?</span> for any single character, for example
               <span class="code">nokia?7???</span> will find Nokia series 7000
            device names. If necessary you can use <span class="code">\</span> to
            escape a wildcard character in a name or pattern.</p>
         
      <p>There are options for case sensitive searching, and using
            regular expression syntax (in which case wildcards won't
            work).</p>
      
      
         
      <h2>Search results</h2>
         
      <p>When the search is complete, MCS displays the results in
            the Search view, and you can work with the results list to
            show device information in the Device Editor.</p>
