<h1>Asset groups</h1>

    
<p>Assets groups are a convenient way of defining the location of a set of assets 
  for subsequent use in components. </p>
<p>In the Asset Group editor you can specify asset group attributes, and then 
  use the asset group name in the asset attributes.</p>
<h2>Asset group attributes</h2>
<p>You can define two types of asset group location; server or device. A server 
  location specifies that an asset in the group is at a location on a server. 
  A device location specifies that the asset will be found on a device. You can 
  also provide a URL to prefix the filename of the asset. </p>
<p>When you refer to an asset group in a component, MCS prefixes the filename 
  in the component <span class="uicontrol">Value</span> with the asset group <span class="uicontrol">Prefix 
  URL</span>.</p>
