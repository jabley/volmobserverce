      <p>In MCS you can name and locate several types of component,
         choose their attributes, and associate them with variants that are bound to one or more compatible devices.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Audio</h2>
         <p>The audio components control sound resources. As with most
            multimedia data, there are different formats with
            different capabilities for audio. Some formats can be
            streamed, for example. In addition, some audio players can
            also be used to play video, or even stream other
            manufacturers content.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Chart</h2>
         <p>Unlike other types of component, device specific variants
            for chart components are generated at runtime, on demand
            rather than being stored in a file.</p>
      
      
      
         <h2>Image</h2>
         <p>Image components can contain still images and in-place
            image sequences, and are referenced by rollover image
            components.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Link</h2>
         <p>Hypertext links in web pages sometimes need to reference
            both device-independent and device-dependent pages. For
            example an email link on a web page might be based on the
            mailto: URL format. The same link on a mobile phone with
            WTA capability, might consist of a phone number, activated
            by clicking.</p>
         <p>To represent these different kinds of link, MCS supports
            links as literals, Java expressions, and as MCS link
            components.</p>
      
      
      
         <h2>Rollover image</h2>
         <p>Rollover image components are not associated with variants.
            There are image component references for two states
            (Normal and Over).</p>
      
      
         <h2>Script</h2>
         <p>MCS supports use of scripts for different languages, such
            as ECMAScript, JavaScript and WMLScript with the script
            component. At run time, MCS selects and uses the most
            appropriate version of the script for the device accessing
            the page.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Text</h2>
         <p>Text components allow you to use device dependent text to
            be used in a variety of ways within a MCS Java Server
            Page. You can use text components in MCS pages wherever a
            text literal can be used.</p>
