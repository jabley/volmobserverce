<h1>Device Repository editor</h1>
<p>You can use the Device Repository editor to edit identification patterns and 
  policy values for any repositories imported into your project. You can edit 
  policy values, and add custom policies to the repository. The editor contains 
  four pages.</p>
<h2>Device selection and identification patterns</h2>
<p>The Devices section on the Overview page contains a tree view of the devices 
  available in the repository. The structure of the tree reflects the fallback 
  hierarchy of the devices. You can expand the tree to make a single device selection. 
  You can also open an Outline view on the device tree and use it to make selections 
  on any of the pages. </p>
<p>The <span class="command">New</span> and <span class="command">Delete</span> 
  buttons are disabled unless a policy under the Custom category is selected.</p>
<p>If any errors are associated with a device, MCS displays an error decoration 
  on the icon and a validation issue decoration on the icon of any fallback devices.</p>
<p>At runtime, MCS uses identification patterns to identify an unknown device. 
  The patterns are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. 
  These patterns are contained in an XML file. The Primary and secondary patterns 
  sections provide an interface to add, change the order, or remove patterns, 
  or to restore the default patterns added in the latest repository update.</p>
<h2>Policy structure</h2>
<p>You can use the Structure page to view the attributes of policies in standard 
  repository categories. You can also add, edit, or remove policies in the Custom 
  category.</p>
<p>The New Policy wizard and the Policy Definition section provide the controls 
  to define a policy; the name, type, available values, and associated meta-information 
  that combine to make a device repository policy.</p>
<p>The Master Value section provides a shortcut to define the value of the policy 
  for the Master device. The available controls are dependent upon the composition 
  and type of the policy.</p>
<p>The CC/PP section provides the means to define the CC/PP vocabulary to which 
  the policy belongs. UAProf is currently the only supported vocabulary.</p>
<h2>Policy values</h2>
<p>The Policies page provide the means to define the policy values for the currently 
  selected device. Each page represents a category of policies. The behavior of 
  each of the pages is identical; they just contain different policies.</p>
<p>MCS displays the policies in alphabetical order of the label in the policy 
  definition. For each policy you can determine whether the current device provides 
  its own value for the policy or if it inherits the value from the nearest ancestor 
  in the fallback hierarchy that provides a value. You can also restore the default 
  value.</p>
<h2>Version information</h2>
<p>The Information page contains version and revision information.</p>
