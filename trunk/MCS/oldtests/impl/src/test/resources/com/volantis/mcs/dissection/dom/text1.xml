    <special:DISSECTABLE-AREA name="area1">
        <p>
            Some text that needs to be dissected. It needs to be quite big
            because otherwise the overhead of the dissectable area    will
            dominate the page size calculations and prevent any dissection
            In fact, it needs to be larger than the dissectable area which
            is 190. It amount it needs to be larger is related to how much
            the bodgy string dissector can dissect into. Since it's thirds
            at the moment, we will need it to be > 190 + 1/3 of this area?
