      <p>In both the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file in MCS, and the
            <span class="filepath">drws-config.xml</span> file in DWS, you can use the
         <span class="code">logging</span> element to configure a service to log information from devices
         that are not recorded in the device repository, and to generate email reports to your
         device service provider. If the <span class="code">logging</span> element is not present, a default log file name is used.</p>
      <p>The information includes</p>
      <ul><li>Device name</li>
         <li>Device type</li>
         <li>Additional information from the request such as TAC.FAC or IMEI number, UA profile URL
            and the header names and values</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The <span class="code">log-file</span> element specifies the full path to the log file, and the
            <span class="code">e-mail-sending</span> element enables and disables the reporting service. If
         reporting is disabled, logging will continue.</p>
      <p>If email is enabled you use the <span class="code">config</span> element container to define the
         parameters for the SMTP mail server, the email address, subject and frequency information
         for the reports.</p>
      <p>A report is considered to be successfully sent if the email process does not throw
         exceptions, and the log file is deleted. The process doesn't check if the recipient
         received and processed the report. If reporting fails, the log entries are not deleted, and
         the service will retry after a period.</p>
     <p>Duplicated entries are filtered out during logging, and the data structure of the filter
         process is rebuilt from the log file after restarting MCS or DWS. However due to memory
         constraints duplicated entries are still possible. Duplicates are also possible between different
         reports.</p>
      <p>Details of the configuration elements can be found in <em>MCS configuration elements</em>.</p>
