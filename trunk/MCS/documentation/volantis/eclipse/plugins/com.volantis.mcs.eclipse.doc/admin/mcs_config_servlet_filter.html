      <h1>Filtering XDIME content</h1>
      
      <p>There may be cases when part of your application content is
         not intended to be handled by MCS, either because the content
         is rendered by another process, or because certain devices
         require different handling.</p>
      
      <p>In the optional <span class="code">servlet-filter</span> section of
         the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file, you can
         configure a filter based on the Servlet 2.3 API. The filter
         identifies device requests that are to be excluded from MCS
         processing, and also ensures that MCS handles only responses
         with XDIME content. Requests that are excluded, and responses
         that are not XDIME, are passed through without modification.</p>
      
      <p>This section also contains the default scope for XDIME page
         caching in the <span class="code">page-cache</span> element.</p>
      
         
      <h2>Excluding devices</h2>
         
      <p>The servlet filter intercepts all requests and continues
            to process them, unless you have excluded a device or one
            of its parents in the device tree, using the required
               <span class="code">name</span> attribute on the
               <span class="code">exclude-device</span> element.</p>
      
      
         
      <h2>Controlling responses</h2>
         
      <p>If a device is not excluded, the filter sets the correct
            character encoding for the device on both the request and
            the response.</p>
         
      <p>In the <span class="code">value</span> attribute on the
               <span class="code">mime-type</span> element, you specify the
            MIME type the servlet filter will treat as XDIME.</p>
         
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			The MIME type values in the
               <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file are
            provisional, and are configurable for a given application,
            so long as they uniquely identify the response as an XDIME
            document. These content types may be changed, or be
            superseded by a registered type.</p>
      
      
         
      <h2>Page caching</h2>
         
      <p>The <span class="code">page-cache</span> element contains the
               <span class="code">defaultScope</span> attribute which contains a
            global scope setting for XDIME page caching. The default
            value is 'none'. Authors can override this value with
            scopes for individual pages, using the
            <span class="code">cacheScope</span> attribute on the
            <span class="code">canvas</span> element.</p>
         
      <p>The <span class="code">jsessionid-name</span> attribute on the
               <span class="code">servlet-filter</span> element contains the
            session ID label used by the MCS web application server.
            MCS uses this value to identify session IDs in content
            URLs and substitute a replacement value before a page cache
            key is created. So pages with different IDs will be reused
            if the IDs are the only content that changes. However, if
            a page contains multiple IDs from different contexts, new
            cache entries will always be made, defeating the purpose of caching. If a server produces variable length IDs for any reason, there may be problems in rendering fragments correctly.</p>
