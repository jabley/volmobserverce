<h1>MCS views</h1>
  
<p>MCS provides the following views:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Format Attributes</li>
  <li>Device Repository</li>
</ul>
<p>In additon MCS makes use of three workbench views:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Navigator</li>
  <li>Outline</li>
  <li>Tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>You use the Navigator view to manage projects, folders and project resources. 
  The Outline and Format Attributes views work in conjunction with the MCS Layout 
  editor. The Device Repository view displays device policy attributes for the 
  device repository associated with a project, and you can use the Outline view 
  with a repository tree. MCS uses the Task view to report on the errors status 
  of all the resources in your MCS project.</p>
