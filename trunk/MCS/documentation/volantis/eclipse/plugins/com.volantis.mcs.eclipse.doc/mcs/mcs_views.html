      <h1>MCS views</h1>
      
      <p>MCS provides the following views:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Device Repository</li>
         
         <li>Format Attributes</li>
         
         <li>Style Rules</li>
         
         <li>Lock</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>In addition MCS makes use of five workbench views:</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>Navigator</li>
         
         <li>Outline</li>
         
         <li>Package Explorer</li>
         
         <li>Problems</li>
         
         <li>Search</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>You use the Navigator or the Package Explorer views to manage
         projects, folders and project resources.</p>
      
      <p>The Outline and Format Attributes views work in conjunction
         with the MCS Layout editor. You can also use the Outline view
         with a device tree when the Device Repository editor is open.
         MCS uses the Problems view to report on the errors status of
         all the resources in your MCS project.</p>
      
      <p>The Style Rules view provides an alternative way to view and refactor all
         the rules for a particular theme variant. </p>
      
      
<p>In the Lock view you can examine the locks held by you, or by all policy users. 
  You can lock any component, or variant that is not locked by another user, and 
  navigate to the editor for the resource that is locked.</p>
      
      <p>You can use the Search view to quickly find devices in the
         Device Repository. When the search results are listed you can
         open the Device Repository editor on a selected device.</p>
      
      <p>Errors shown in the Problems view for all projects are linked
         to listings in the policy editors and show in icons in the
         Navigator and Package Explorer views.</p>
