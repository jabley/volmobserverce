<h1>Validation</h1>
  
<p>When MCS validates the content of work you have done, it reports any problems. 
  What you see depends on the situation.</p>
<h2>Policy editor errors</h2>
<p>In the Alerts and Action Items section of a policy editor, the error information 
  is updated each time you make a change. For example when you add a new asset 
  to a component, MCS validates the change and reports on any required attributes 
  that are missing. As you enter valid attribute data the list changes until there 
  are no errors showing.</p>
<p>If there are any current errors, you'll see a link to the relevant items in 
  the Task view, for example, 'There are 2 errors 0, warnings and 3 tasks associated 
  with this theme'. You can click on the link to highlight the items in the Task 
  list. If there are no errors, you'll see 'No alerts at this time'.</p>
<p> The figure shows an example. </p>

<h2>Errors in the Task view</h2>
<p>The same problems are also included in the workbench Task view. If the Task 
  view is closed when MCS first reports an error, MCS opens it the Task view to 
  show the problem.</p>

<p>The task list contains all the outstanding items that need your attention. 
  When you <span class="command">Go To</span> an MCS resource on the Task list, 
  MCS brings the resource tab to the front (or opens the editor if it is closed), 
  and highlights the control where the problem is.</p>
<h2>Errors in dialogs</h2>
<p>Errors in dialogs are shown by text in the body of the dialog.</p>

<h2>Errors in lists</h2>
<p>Errors in asset lists are indicated by an asset icon with an error decoration.</p>
