      <p>The Locks view shows you the current status of all the locks
         on policies and variants held by users in collaborative
         projects. The view displays:</p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Status icon</dt>
         <dd>Lock icon in any row where the listed policy or variant
            is locked</dd>
         <dt>Resource</dt>
         <dd>The name of the policy, or the summary information used
            to identify the variant</dd>
         
  <dt>In Folder</dt>
         <dd>Project relative folder path of the policy</dd>
         <dt>User</dt>
         <dd>Display name of the user who holds the lock</dd>
         
  <dt>Locked since</dt>
         <dd>Date and time that the lock was applied</dd>
      </dl>
      <p class="caption"/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<p><img src="../graphics/locks_view_ui.png" alt="Locks view" title="Locks view"/></p>
      <p>You can change the width of columns, select rows and scroll
         the list, and expand policy names in the Resource column to
         display the related variants.</p>
      <p>You can click the <span class="command">Menu</span> button in the
         toolbar and choose between <span class="command">Filters</span> and
            <span class="command">Refresh Options</span>.
         <span class="command">Filters</span> opens a dialog where you can
         toggle the view between policies on which you have a lock,
         and all locked policies. <span class="command">Refresh Options</span>
         allows you to set the automatic refresh interval for the
         view. The <span class="command">Refresh</span> button forces an update
         from the database.</p>
      
<p>Using the context menu you can acquire a <span class="command">Lock</span> 
  on an unlocked policy or variant, but you cannot <span class="command">Unlock</span> 
  a resource held by anyone else. <span class="command">Go To </span> navigates 
  you to the editor for a policy or variant directly.</p>
