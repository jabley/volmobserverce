      <h1 class="ocp">Locking and unlocking policies</h1>
    <p>In collaborative projects, you can lock or unlock policies as a whole, a single variant or multiple variants. Each  pair of <span class="command">Lock</span> and <span class="command">Unlock</span> buttons in the  Attributes and Variants sections of the policy editors toggle one another. The buttons in the Attributes sections act on the policy a whole, while those in the Variants section act on one or more variants.</p>
         
      <p>When you add a policy or a variant it is initially locked, so you will be able to edit it immediately. If you lock a resource, the edit controls are enabled, and no other user can edit the related content. Your locked policies and variants are displayed with decorations on the standard icons..</p>
         
      <p>If you try to lock any resources and the lock fails, you will see a dialog showing the current lock status on the resources and which users have the locks.</p>
         
         
      <p>Each time you save a policy, MCS updates the database, refreshes the local polices, and unlocks the resources you were editing. If you unlock a resource before you save it, you will see a dialog giving you the option to save or discard your changes.</p>
         
      <p>If you try to lock, save, unlock or refresh any local resources, you may see a message that the database connection has been lost.</p>
