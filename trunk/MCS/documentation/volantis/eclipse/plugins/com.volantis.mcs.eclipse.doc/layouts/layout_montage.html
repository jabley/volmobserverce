<h1>Montages and segments</h1>
<p>In a montage layout you can use segments or frames to position the output from 
  multiple canvasses on a device. You should use montage layouts for large-screen 
  devices, ideally for those that support frames. </p>
<p>The figure shows how a simple montage layout appears in the Layout editor's 
  Design page.The grid format consists of three rows, each of which contains a 
  segment. The top row displays a title and images for the web site, The middle 
  row holds a site menu. The bottom row contains canvasses selected in the menu 
  segment.</p>
<p><img src="../images/layout_montage.png" alt="A montage layout with segments" longdesc="" /></p>
<p> As in all layouts, each segment must have a unique name that you use to specify 
  where output from the canvasses appears.</p>
<p>Each segment has attributes associated with it. These attributes can affect 
  the formatting that is applied as the page is generated. Frame and segment attributes 
  set values for frame margins, determine whether you can resize a frame or scroll 
  its content, and so on. </p>
