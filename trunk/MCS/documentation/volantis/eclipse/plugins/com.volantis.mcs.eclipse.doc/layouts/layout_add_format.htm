<h1>Adding a format</h1>
<p>When you first design a device layout, you begin your design by adding one 
  or more two-dimensional grids to contain other layout formats. After you have 
  created a grid structure for your layout, you can begin to add formats like 
  panes and fragments to hold web page content.</p>
<p>The sequence of laying out formats varies somewhat with the format type, but 
  all follow this basic pattern.</p>
<p class="taskhead">To add a format:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a device in the Outline view</li>
  <li>Expand the outline to show any empty formats in the location you want to 
    place the new format</li>
  <li>Right-click and choose <span class="command">Add</span>, and then select 
    the format from the context menu. The icon for the format is added to the 
    Outline view.</li>
  <li>In the Format Attributes view enter the attribute values for the format. 
    The number and type of attribute values varies with the type of format you've 
    added. A format <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> is always required.</li>
</ol>
<p><span class="taskhead">To remove a format:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a format in the Outline view</li>
  <li>Right click and choose <span class="command">Remove</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="command">Remove</span> does not remove the containing grid cell. 
  It clears the format from the cell, leaving an empty format. To remove grid 
  cells you need to choose <span class="command">Grid</span>  |  <span class="command">Remove 
  Column</span> or <span class="command">Grid</span>  |  <span class="command">Remove 
  Row</span>.</p>
<p class="note">Tip: You can <span class="command">Cut</span>, <span class="command">Copy</span> 
  and <span class="command">Paste</span> formats, including their attributes, 
  from one grid cell to another, and between layouts.</p>
