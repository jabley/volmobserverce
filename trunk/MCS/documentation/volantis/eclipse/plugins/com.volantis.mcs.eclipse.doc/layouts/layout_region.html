<h1>Regions</h1>
<p>Portals are web sites that combine material from a variety of sources into 
  a single presentation. They provide a focal point for information delivery but 
  do not control all of the material that they deliver. </p>
<p>Each page is a template with some common content and a set of areas that can 
  be occupied by variable content. The areas are known as regions. The content 
  that occupies a region is known as a portlet.</p>
<p>In MCS, a portal is a canvas with some specific attributes, and a region is 
  a format that you define in a layout. The name you give the region is associated 
  with the XDIME markup with the <span class="code">name</span> attribute of the 
  <span class="code">region</span> element.</p>
<p>You cannot position multiple portlets within a single region. If you include 
  several portlets MCS will display them sequentially. If you need to separate 
  portlet content, you should create individual regions for each portlet.</p>
