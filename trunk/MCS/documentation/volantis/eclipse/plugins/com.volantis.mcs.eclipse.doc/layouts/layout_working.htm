<h1>Working with layouts</h1>
<p>Layout policies allow you to deliver the same content to users of different 
  devices by taking account of their characteristics, keeping content and layout 
  completely separate.</p>
<p>To develop a layout in MCS you have to compete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Add a layout</strong> policy to your project using the New Layout 
    wizard</li>
  <li>Using the Layout editor, <strong>choose a device</strong> or devices to 
    associate with your layout</li>
  <li><strong>Add formats</strong> to the layout and assign attributes to them 
    in the Format Attribute view</li>
</ol>
