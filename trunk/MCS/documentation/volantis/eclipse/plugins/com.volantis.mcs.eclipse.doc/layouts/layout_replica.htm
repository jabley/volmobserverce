<h1>Replicas</h1>
<p>Fragmented pages often have features that you want to apply to all fragments, 
  for example common navigation and menu bars.</p>
<p>You can use a replica format to use content from another format in another 
  part of the layout. You refer to the other format using the replica's <span class="uicontrol">Source 
  Format Name</span> attribute. </p>
<p>The source format you refer to in a replica must be in a different fragment 
  to the one containing the replica. This is because MCS continues to use the 
  pane name in the source format when it replaces the replica. In addition, pane 
  names must remain unique.</p>
<p>In the figure, the logo, title, and index panes contain material that is needed 
  in all three fragments. The panes are part of the default fragment, F0, so MCS 
  will be render them whenever F0 is visited. They are also needed in fragments 
  F1 and F2.</p>
<p>Replica R1 refers to the logo pane, and when fragment F1 is rendered, R1 is 
  replaced by the logo pane. The same is true for replicas R2 and R3 which MCS 
  replaces with the title and index panes. When MCS renders fragment F2, which 
  has identical references, the three panes are displayed in the same way.</p>
