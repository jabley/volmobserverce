<h1>Fragments</h1>
  
<p>Compared to PCs, PDAs and phones have limited display capability, so you often 
  need to modify the content sent to them. Text can very difficult to read if 
  users have to scroll it both horizontally and vertically, for example.</p>
<p> MCS allows you to split your content into a series of pages with links to 
  provide navigation between them. Each individual page generated from a larger 
  layout is called a fragment. </p>
<p>The first step in creating a fragment set is to create a root fragment for 
  the whole canvas. This fragment will contain the links to the other fragments. 
  The other fragments each contain a link back to the root fragment. So users 
  can select and traverse the links just as they would for any other web link. 
</p>
<p>The figure shows a canvas layout divided into six fragments. The root fragment 
  is a pane in the first row of a two-row format. The root fragment contains the 
  links to the other fragments that allow them to be accessed. The second row 
  of this format consists of a three-column format, with panes for fragments 1 
  and 2. The third column consists of a three-row format for fragments 3-5. </p>
<p>When MCS delivers this layout to a small device, it will be displayed as the 
  set of pages, starting with the content in the root fragment and its links.</p>

<p>MCS binds the fragment in the layout to the XDIME markup using the <span class="code">name</span> 
  attribute of the fragment element.</p>
<pre class="code">&lt;canvas layoutName=&quot;layout1&quot;&gt;
  &lt;layout&gt;
     &lt;fragment name=&quot;F1&quot; linkText=&quot;Your basket&quot; backLinkText=&quot;Continue 
  shopping&quot;&gt;
     .
     .
     &lt;/fragment&gt;
  &lt;/layout&gt;
  .
  .
&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
