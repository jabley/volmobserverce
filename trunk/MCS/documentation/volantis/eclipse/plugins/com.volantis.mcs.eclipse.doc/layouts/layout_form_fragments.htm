<h1>Form fragments</h1>
  
<p>You can use form fragments to manage the display of forms that are too large 
  to present on devices with small screens. MCS combines the results from each 
  of the form fragments before the form 's data is processed.</p>
<p>You create form fragments by wrapping the content of a form (rows or columns) 
  in a form fragment.</p>
