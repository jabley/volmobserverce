<h1>Adding a layout</h1>
<p>You can use the New Layout wizard to create device layouts. The wizard allows 
  you to define:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A layout name and its location in your project folders</li>
  <li>Select a one or more devices to which the layout applies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naming a layout</h2>
<p>The first page allows you to locate and name the layout. Each layout is a file 
  in your project. The focus will initially be on the <span><span class="uicontrol">Layout 
  </span></span> text box, and the policy tree view will be synchronized with 
  your current project folder selection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <a href="../mcs/mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="Layout wizard">Layout 
    wizard</a></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
  <li>Enter the layout name in the text box</li>
  <li>Choose a folder in the policy tree view, or enter the full path from the 
    project folder in the first text box</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span> and <a href="../devices/device_choose.htm" title="Choose a device">choose 
    a device</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The new layout icon is displayed in the policy tree, and a Layout editor tab 
  is opened and highlighted.</p>
<h2>Defining layout attributes</h2>
<p>The editor has two pages, Overview and Design. To change pages, click one of 
  the tabs at the bottom left of the editor.</p>
<p>On the Overview tab you'll see a list of the devices you selected for this 
  layout. You can add new devices or remove them at any time using the <span class="command">Browse</span> 
  or <span class="command">Delete</span> buttons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Device Layouts list, select the device name you want to edit</li>
  <li>Enter the attribute values</li>
  <li>Go to the Design tab to begin your design</li>
</ol>
