<h1>About layouts</h1>
<img src="../icons/layout_banner.gif" alt="Layout banner" title="Layout banner" align="left"/>
<p>To display content on a range of devices you need to specify
  a layout policy with variants that are suited to
  different device characteristics. Then you associate the
  variants with one or more devices. You give every layout a
  name that MCS uses to associate it with XDIME markup.
  When you choose these devices, you also define one of two
  categories of layout; a canvas or a montage.</p>
<h2>Canvas layouts</h2>
<p>You will find that you can use canvas layouts for most
  pages targeting multiple devices. You can divide a canvas
  layout into panes that will display your web content.</p>
<p>With smaller device displays, you also need to consider
  ways to partition the content. For example, a page
  authored for a PC screen will be much too large for a PDA.
  The solution is to divide the content into a set of page
  fragments that are small enough for display. Then you
  provide navigation links between the
  fragments.</p>
<h2>Montage layouts</h2>
<p>In cases where you are targeting larger screens such as
  PCs with browsers that support frames, you can use a
  montage layout that can contain several canvasses. The
  relation of a canvas to a montage is similar to the
  relation between a pane and a canvas.</p>
<p>Montage layouts allow you to aggregate content from
  multiple pages into a single display. You divide the
  montage layout into segments (equivalent to a canvas) and
  allocate different canvasses (or another montage) to each
  segment.</p>
<p>If a device can render frames, it will display the montage
  with one segment in each frame of a frameset. Otherwise,
  it will display a default segment, with other segments
  linked to it.</p>
<h2>Formats in layouts</h2>
<p>You add layouts to your project with the New Layout
  wizard. Then you associate the layout with devices in the
  Layout editor. You also use the Layout editor to create a
  grid structure that corresponds to a web page. Then you
  add further layout formats to the grid, and assign
  attributes to them, such as width, height, background
  color and images.</p>
