      <p>Compared to PCs, PDAs and phones have limited display
         capability, so you often need to modify the content sent to
         them. Text can be very difficult to read if users have to scroll
         it both horizontally and vertically, for example.</p>
      <p> MCS allows you to split your content into a series of pages
         with links to provide navigation between them. Each
         individual page generated from a larger layout is called a
         fragment. </p>
      <p>The first step in creating a fragment set is to create a root
         fragment for the whole canvas. This fragment will contain the
         links to the other fragments. The other fragments each
         contain a link back to the root fragment. So users can select
         and traverse the links just as they would for any other web
         link.</p>
      <p>The figure shows a canvas layout divided into six fragments.
         The root fragment is a pane in the first row of a two-row
         format. The root fragment contains the links to the other
         fragments that allow them to be accessed. The second row of
         this format consists of a three-column format, with panes for
         fragments 1 and 2. The third column consists of a three-row
         format for fragments 3-5.</p>
      <p>When MCS delivers this layout to a small device, it will be
         displayed as the set of pages, starting with the content in
         the root fragment and its links.</p>

      <p>MCS binds the fragment in the layout to the XDIME markup
         using the <span class="code">name</span> attribute of the fragment
         element.</p>
      <pre class="code">&lt;canvas layoutName="/layout1.mlyt"&gt;
   &lt;layout&gt;
      &lt;fragment name="F1" linkText="Your basket" backLinkText="Continue
         shopping"&gt;
      &lt;/fragment&gt;
   &lt;/layout&gt;
   ...
&lt;/canvas&gt; </pre>
