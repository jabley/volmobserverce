<h1>About layouts<img src="../images/layout_banner.gif" width="75" height="58" align="left" alt="Layout icon"></h1>
<p>To display content in a web browser you need to specify a layout policy, and 
  associate it with one or more devices. You give every layout a name that MCS 
  uses to associate it with the related devices. When you choose these devices, 
  you also define one of two categories of layout; a canvas or a montage.</p>
<h2>Canvas layouts</h2>
<p>You will find that you can use canvas layouts for most pages targeting multiple 
  devices. You can divide a canvas layout into panes that will display your web 
  content. </p>
<p>With smaller device displays, you also need to consider ways to partition the 
  content. For example, a page authored for a PC screen will be much too large 
  for a PDA. The solution is to divide the content into a set of page fragments 
  that are small enough for display. Then you provide navigation links between 
  between the fragments.</p>
<h2>Montage layouts</h2>
<p>In special cases, where you are targeting larger screens such as PCs with browsers 
  that support frames, you can use a montage layout that can contain several canvasses. 
  The relation of a canvas to a montage is similar to the relation between a pane 
  and a canvas.</p>
<p>Montage layouts allow you to aggregate content from multiple pages into a single 
  display. You divide the montage layout into segments (equivalent to a canvas) 
  and allocate different canvasses (or another montage) to each segment.</p>
<p>If a device can render frames, it will display the montage with one segment 
  in each frame of a frameset. Otherwise, it will display a default segment, with 
  other segments linked to it.</p>
<h2>Formats in layouts</h2>
<p>You add layouts to your project with the New Layout wizard. Then you associate 
  the layout with devices in the Layout editor. You also use the Layout editor 
  to create a grid structure that corresponds to a web page. Then you add further 
  layout formats to the grid, and assign attributes to them, such as width, height, 
  background color and images.</p>
