<h1>Wrapping a format</h1>
<p>When you first create a device layout you can begin your design by adding grids 
  to build a structure. </p>
<p>However, you often find that you need to add additional structure after you 
  have added formats. You can do this by wrapping a format in a grid. You can 
  also wrap formats in iterators, fragments and forms.</p>
<p><span class="taskhead">To wrap a format:</span></p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Outline view select the format you want to wrap</li>
  <li>Right-click and choose <span class="command">Wrap</span> followed by the 
    format you want to use</li>
</ol>
<p>The wrapped format is placed inside the new one, or in the first cell in an 
  N by M grid,</p>
