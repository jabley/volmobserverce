      <p>There is a component editor for each component type. There
         are some differences related to the component type, but they
         share several features.</p>
      <p>All the editors have controls grouped in the following
         sections.</p>
      
         <h2>Component attributes</h2>
         <p>Each editor contains a section defining the attributes of
            the component. You can use the <span class="uicontrol">Device category
            scheme</span> control to associate an existing device category scheme or a custom scheme
            with the policy. For more information on using a custom scheme, refer to <em>Custom device policies</em>.</p>
         <p>In some editors additional attribute values are fallback
            component names to which the current component refers. For
            example, a chart component has three possible fallback
            types. In other cases such as rollover image components,
            they are references to the actual image components used.
            In all cases you can <span class="command">Browse</span> to locate
            the component to refer to.</p>
            <p>The <span class="command">Lock</span> and <span class="command">Unlock</span> buttons are displayed if this is a collaborative project. If you use them, the action applies to all the policy attributes.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Variants</h2>
         <p>Any variants that you have added to a component are listed
            in the Variants section. You can add and remove variants at
            any time. Some components support multiple variants, while
            others, such as charts, allow only a single variant
            reference.</p>
         <p>Common to all Variants sections are buttons to
            <span class="command">Add</span> or <span class="command">Delete</span>
            variants, and a variants list. The Variant section for an image
            component also has a <span class="command">New</span> button. When
            you add image variants, you can browse to a directory and
            filter for a file type, and in some cases see a preview of
            the image. MCS also obtains some image variant attributes
            from the file system.</p>
         <p>Variant icons in the list are like the icons in the policy
            tree, with a blue lozenge decoration. When you select an
            variant in the list, the Selection Criteria, Content and
            Metadata sections of the  editor are enabled, and you
            can edit the attribute values. You can also choose
            multiple variants, and apply values that are common to those
            variants to all items in the selection.</p>
         <p>The <span class="command">Lock</span> and <span class="command">Unlock</span> buttons apply to the selected component variant.</p>
       
      
         <h2>Variant Selection Criteria</h2>
         <p>You use this section to define which variant
            is selected for use on a particular device. If the variant is targeted, you can choose
            a combination of targets from the device tree and a single set of devices in a custom category scheme.</p>
            
      
      
         <h2>Variant Content</h2>
         <p>All variants have a <span class="uicontrol">URL</span> control,
            which is most often the filename of the variant.
            Script and text variants additionally can be entered
            directly in the content section as an alternative to using
            a file resource.</p>
         <p>In this section you can also add a reference to a asset
            group, and
            also specify a null variant</p>
      
      
         <h2>Variant Metadata</h2>
         <p>Metadata is information about the policy variant that is used by MCS to determine how to use the variant when it has been selected.</p>
         <p>In this section you can set values such as MIME type, rendering, height and width values, the available controls depending on the component type you are working with.</p>
