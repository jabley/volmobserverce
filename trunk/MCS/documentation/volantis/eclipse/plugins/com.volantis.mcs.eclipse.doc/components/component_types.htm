<h1>Component types</h1>
<p>In MCS you can name and locate several types of component, choose their attributes, 
  and associate them with assets.</p>
<h2>Audio</h2>
<p>The audio components control sound resources. As with most multimedia data, 
  there are different formats with different capabilities for audio. Some formats 
  can be streamed, for example. In addition, some audio players can also be used 
  to play video, or even stream other manufacturers content.</p>
<h2>Chart</h2>
<p>Unlike other types of component, device specific assets for chart components 
  are generated at runtime on demand rather than being stored in a file.</p>
<h2>Dynamic visual</h2>
<p>Dynamic visual components controls dynamic media resources, such as video and 
  animation These include animations, such as those provided by Macromedia Flash 
  and Shockwave. Though one common use for this kind of technology is delivery 
  of animations to web pages, there are other uses. For example, Flash movies 
  can in fact be graphical user interfaces. </p>
<h2>Image</h2>
<p>Image components provide for still image resources, and are referenced by rollover 
  image components.</p>
<h2>Link</h2>
<p>Hypertext links in web pages sometimes need to reference both device-independent 
  and device-dependent pages. For example an E-mail link on a web page might be 
  based on the mailto: URL format. The same link on a mobile phone with WTA capability, 
  might consist of a phone number, activated by clicking.</p>
<p>To represent these different kinds of link, MCS supports links as literals, 
  Java expressions, and as MCS link components.<br>
</p>
<h2>Rollover image</h2>
<p>Rollover image components are not associated with assets. There are image component 
  references for two states (Normal and Over).</p>
<h2>Script</h2>
<p>MCS supports use of scripts for different languages, such as ECMAScript, JavaScript 
  and WMLScript with the script component. At run time, MCS selects and uses the 
  most appropriate version of the script for the device accessing the page.</p>
<h2>Text</h2>
<p>Text components allow allow you to use device dependent text to be used in a variety of ways within a MCS Java Server Page. You can use text components in MCS pages wherever a text literal can be used.</p>
