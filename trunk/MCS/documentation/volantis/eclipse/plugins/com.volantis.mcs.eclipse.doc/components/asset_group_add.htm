<h1>Adding an asset group</h1>
<p>In MCS, you can use the Asset Group wizard to define the location of sets of 
  assets. The wizard allows you to define:</p>
<ul>
  <li> An asset group name and its location in your project folders</li>
  <li>Attributes or references to asset files</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naming an asset group</h2>
<p>On the first page you can locate and name the asset group. Each group defines 
  a location on your web server or on a device. The focus will initially be on 
  the <span class="uicontrol">Asset Group</span> text box, and the policy tree 
  view will be synchronized with your current project folder selection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <a href="../mcs/mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="New Asset Group wizard">New 
    Asset Group wizard</a></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
  <li>Enter the group name in the text box</li>
  <li>Choose a folder in the policy tree view or enter the full path from the 
    project folder in the first text box</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Defining group attributes</h2>
<p>On the next page you can enter a location for the asset group and a prefix 
  URL to use as a prefix for the asset names in this group.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose either Server or Device from the <span class="uicontrol">Location</span> 
    drop-down.</li>
  <li>Enter a <span class="uicontrol">Prefix URL</span> for the group.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard.</li>
</ol>
