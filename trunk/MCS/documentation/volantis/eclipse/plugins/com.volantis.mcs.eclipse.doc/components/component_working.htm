<h1>Working with components and assets</h1>
<p>In your project you can use component policies to associate assets with components. 
  However, not all components can be associated with assets. For example, you 
  cannot add assets to either button or rollover images. </p>
<p>To develop a component policy in MCS you have to complete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Add a component</strong> policy to your project using the New Component 
    wizard</li>
  <li>Using a component editor, <strong>choose an asset</strong> or assets to 
    associate with your component</li>
  <li><strong>Add an asset group</strong> to locate the assets on a server or 
    device</li>
</ol>
