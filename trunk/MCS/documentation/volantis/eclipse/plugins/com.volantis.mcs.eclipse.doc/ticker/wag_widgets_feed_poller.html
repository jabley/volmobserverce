      <p>A Feed Poller is a utility widget that enables the BuzzCast Client to poll the server for
         feed updates. The communication between Feed Poller widget and BuzzCast Server is based on
         HTTP protocol. The communication is always initiated by the Feed Poller widget, which will
         send HTTP requests to the BuzzCast Server.</p>
      <p>The feed poller requests the rendered feed content from the server using a regular but
         configurable polling cycle. Each feed item is a pre-rendered markup construct containing a
         title, title icon, channel and an item description, and having a unique ID. The title and
         description may contain markup.</p>
      <p>Each item is identified by a unique item ID, and on each AJAX request, the client informs
         the server about which items it already has, so the server does not need to track the items
         held by each client. It is a BuzzCast Server responsible to generate ID for each item. On
         each update, the server provides items that are not already held by the client. The server
         also indicates the IDs of those items that the client reported that it had, but which are
         no longer included in the feed so should be discarded by the client.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the client state is lost for some reason, then all of the current items
         will be delivered again.</div>
      <p>On every request to the server for an update, the BuzzCast client passes all current
         usage-tracking information back to the server.</p>
      <p>The skip times prevent polling occurring during scheduled hours. Up to two skip times per
         day are supported by the Feed Poller widget, and these can also be configured as parameters
         via the server-side configuration mechanism. The skip times are relative to the client
         device's local clock.</p>
      
         <h2>HTTP requests</h2>
         <p>The Feed Poller widget sends HTTP requests of two kinds: initial and incremental.</p>
         <p>Initial request is sent by the Feed Poller upon its Initialization. In that case, the
            full feed content needs to be sent down by the BuzzCast Server, including items and
            configuration parameters.</p>
         <p>Once an initial request has been sent, further requests will be incremental. The Feed
            Poller will enclose information about its current content, and the BuzzCast Server will
            send down only that portion of data, which have changed.</p>
         <p>The value of the context parameter is encoded as follows:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The value consists of 3 substrings separated by a '~' (tilde) character</li>
            <li>Each substring keeps information about one of the items group. There are in order:</li>
            <ol>
               <li>the items that haven't been read yet</li>
               <li>the items that have been read</li>
               <li>the items that have been read, and the link has been followed</li>
            </ol>
            <li>Each items group is a dot-separated substring that contains item ID</li>
         </ul>
         <p>The following examples illustrate initial and incremental requests.</p>
         <pre class="code">
http://www.feed.com/vmds
http://www.feed.com/vmds?context=AbC6~7435.JuHu~45hs</pre>
         <p>The second request indicates, that there are currently 4 items stored by the Feed
            Poller, with following IDs: 'AbC6', '7435', 'JuHu', and '45hs'. The first item has not
            been read, the second and third have been read, and the fourth item's link was
         followed.</p>
      
      
         <h2>XDIME 2 elements</h2>
         <p>Example shown below defines a simple Feed Poller widget.</p>
         <pre class="code">
&lt;ticker:feed-poller url="http://www.myfeed.com/vmds"/&gt;</pre>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <span class="code">ticker:feed-poller</span> element must be placed before
            all other BuzzCast Client related elements on the XDIME 2 page.</div>
         <p>In this widget response example, following commands will be executed:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>insert new item with specified ID, channel, title and description</li>
            <li>remove item with specified ID</li>
            <li>set (redirect) URL to the new BuzzCast Server</li>
            <li>set new skip times to be between 11:00-12:00, and 22:00-2:30</li>
            <li>set new polling interval to 10 minutes</li>
         </ul>
