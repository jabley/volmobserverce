      <p>Installing and configuring the Device Repository Web Service
         (DWS) is very straitforward, using a wizard that installs all
         the required files, including a recent repository version,
         The Tomcat web application server, code samples illustrating
         the REST API, and command line interfaces to update the
         repository.</p>
      
         <h2>Required software</h2>
         <p>DWS operates as an application within a web application
            server. The DWS installation wizard provides an option to
            install the required Tomcat 5.5.</p>
         <p>If you wish to use an existing Tomcat installation you
            will need to make several settings manually. For example,
            you might want to use a different certificate. <em>Configuring the DWS server</em> outlines the steps required.</p>
               <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: DWS is currently supported on Tomcat 5.5 only.</div>
        
      
      
         <h2>Running the installer</h2>
         <p>You install DWS with an wizard that steps you through a
            series of pages containing settings that correspond to the
            entries in the configuration files. You click
               <span class="command">Next</span> to complete the following
            actions.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Accept the Licence Agreement on the second page</li>
            <li>Accept the 'Full Install' option for
                  <span class="uicontrol">Install Set</span>. Alternatively,
               choose 'Custom' and check the options you require.</li>
            <li>Enter the install file location for DWS, for example
                  <span class="filepath">/workspace/webapps/DRWS</span></li>
            <li>Set the <span class="uicontrol">Username</span> to 'drws_user'
               and the <span class="uicontrol">Password</span> to
               'drws_password'</li>
            <li>On the Installation Summary review your settings</li>
            <li>Click <span class="command">Install</span> to complete the
               installation</li>
         </ol>
      
      
         <h2>Configuring the installed Tomcat server</h2>
         <p>If you chose the option to install Tomcat, you will find
            that Tomcat is installed in the location you specified,
            with the following predefined configuration.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The <span class="filepath">server.xml</span> file has a minimal
               configuration that starts only the SSL connector
               required for DWS. The original
               <span class="filepath">server.xml</span> file is also installed,
               but renamed to <span class="filepath">server-default.xml</span>.</li>
            <li>The <span class="filepath">tomcat-users.xml</span> file
               contains the user and role required for basic
               authentication, with the username and password that you
               entered during installation</li>
            <li>A <span class="filepath">.keystore file</span> with a SSL
               self-signed certificate generated for host 'localhost'</li>
            <li>A <span class="filepath">drws.xml</span> context file deployed
               in the <span class="filepath">conf/Catalina/localhost</span>
               directory</li>
         </ul>
         <p class="taskhead">To install DWS as a web application:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Create a <span class="filepath">drws</span> directory under
                  <span class="filepath">/workspace/webapps/DRWS/tomcat/webapps</span></li>
            <li>Enter the command
                  <pre class="code">cp -r /workspace/webapps/DRWS/webapp/* drws </pre></li>
            <li>Enter the command
                  <pre class="code">export [tomcat_home]=/workspace/webapps/DRWS/tomcat/ </pre></li>
            <li>In
               <span class="filepath">/workspace/webapps/DRWS/tomcat/bin</span>
               start Tomcat by running <span class="filepath">startup.sh</span></li>
            <p>After setting up SSL the DWS URL will have the
               following form.</p>
            <pre class="code">https://[username]:[password]@[hostname]:[portnumber]/[context_root]/[request_path]</pre>
