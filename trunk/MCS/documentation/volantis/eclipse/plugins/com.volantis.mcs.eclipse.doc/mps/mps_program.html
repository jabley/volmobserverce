      <h1>Programming MPS</h1>
        
      <p>You can use the Message Preparation Services API
            (MPSAPI) to develop MPS applications. Details of the API are contained in the JavaDoc, and the code fragments in this section illustrate its use.</p>
        
      <p>The main steps in programming MPS applications are:</p>
        
      <ul>
            
         <li> Establishing the <strong>
               <b>session</b>
            </strong> 
         </li>
            
         <li> Adding <strong>
               <b>attachments</b>
            </strong> 
         </li>
            
         <li> Adding <strong>
               <b>recipients</b>
            </strong> 
         </li>
            
         <li> Resolving <strong>
               <b>channels and devices</b>
            </strong> 
         </li>
        
      </ul>
       
        
            
      <h2>Establishing the session</h2>
            
      <p>The example servlet uses the following code to define 
                the application and then initialize it.</p>
            
                
      <pre class="code">MarinerServletApplication mpsTest;           
   public RunMps() {
   }
   public void init() throws ServletException {
      super.init();
      mpsTest = MarinerServletApplication.getInstance(
                getServletConfig().getServletContext());
   }</pre>
            
            
      <p>If you initialize MCS from a custom application that has its own servlet
context you should use something like the following code.</p>

      <pre class="code">
ServletContext sc = pageContext.getServletContext().getContext("/mcs")

MarinerServletApplication example =
MarinerServletApplication.getInstance(sc);}</pre>
        
        
            
      <h2>Adding attachments</h2>
            
      <p>Multipart MIME messages generated for MPS may need to carry arbitrary attachments if the channel adapter supports attachments. Such attachments are not referenced from
                within the body of the message but travel with it. The
                attachments can include things such as:</p>
            
      <ul>
                
         <li>Manufacturer-specific ringtones</li>
                
         <li>Java applications</li>
                
         <li>Executable content in other formats (such as
                    Mophun, BREW)</li>
                
         <li>vCard, vCalendar entries</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p>Allowing attachments to MPS messages supports the use
                of MPS as a delivery mechanism for provisioning. For
                this use, no device independence is required for
                attachments, since the attachment objects(s) would
                have been pre-selected by the provisioning engine.</p>
            
      <p>Device dependent attachments are supported</p>
            
      <p>MPS can include arbitrary objects in the rendered
                multipart MIME message, such that they will be treated
                as an attachment by the receiving MMS client. An
                attachment in this context is an object that is
                included as part of the multipart/related MIME message
                but is not referenced by the markup (root) part of the
                message (for example the MMS SMIL part in MMS).</p>
            
      <p>You specify the list of attachments through MPSAPI using either local or
                fully-qualified URLs. A local URLs must be the fully qualified file path to the attachment on the server where MPS is installed.</p>
            
      <p>When a message is rendered for a message type that does
                not support attachments (such as SMS), then any
                attachments specified are ignored.</p>
            
      <p>The classes provided for handling message attachments
                are: <span class="code">MessageAttachments</span>,
                <span class="code">MessageAttachment</span> and <span class="code">DeviceMessageAttachment</span>.</p>
            
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			All slashes ('/')in the file attachment path
                are treated as path separators for compatibility with
                Windows and Linux platforms. There is no need to
                escape space characters.</p>
        
        
            
      <h2>Create a MessageAttachments object</h2>
            
      <p>In the example servlet the following code creates a
                <span class="code">MessageAttachments</span> object from the parameters coming
                in from the HTTP request.</p>
            
                
      <pre class="code">private MessageAttachments getAttachments(HttpServletRequest request) {
   String attachment[] = request.getParameterValues("attachment");
   String attachmentValueType[] = request.getParameterValues(
   String attachmentChannel[] = request.getParameterValues(
   String attachmentDevice[] = request.getParameterValues(

      for(int i=0;i&lt;attachment.length;i++){
         if(!attachment[i].equals("")){

            try {
               dma.setChannelName(attachmentChannel[i]);
               dma.setDeviceName(attachmentDevice[i]);
               dma.setValue(attachment[i]);

      <h2>Adding recipients</h2>
            
      <p>The following code loads a recipient set from the
                ServletRequest by looking at parameters 'recipients'
                and 'device'. If 'device' = "" or there are fewer
                devices than recipients then no device is specified
                for the recipient. If the channel is specified as SMS
                then the MSISDN of the recipient is set rather than
                the address.</p>
            
                
      <pre class="code">private MessageRecipients getRecipients(HttpServletRequest
