      <h1>Using MPS interfaces</h1>
        
      <p>You invoke MPS through the Message Preparation Services API
            (MPSAPI). You create an XDIME file, which
            uses the <span class="code">message</span> element to contain a
            <span class="code">canvas</span>. MPS generates a message
            containing all the content required for rendering on the
            end-user's device, and transmits the message using channel-specific APIs.</p>
        
      <p>In order to use MPS you must:</p>
        
      <ul>
            
         <li>Write a servlet or portlet that will run in the same web application as MCS and MPS, and that uses the MPSAPI</li>
            
         <li>Create the device independent message using XDIME</li>
            
         <li>Create the policies referenced by the message and import them into the MCS repository</li>
            
         <li>Optionally provide an implementation of the mapping
                from address to device and channel</li>
        
      </ul>
        
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			Callers can request that messages that are not channel-specific are
            returned to them rather than being sent across the network
            by MPS itself.</p>
        
      <p>Since a message preparation request normally involves
            transmission to multiple users, who may be using different
            devices, each step may be required to generate multiple
            copies of its output. Caching of static information is an
            important part of the preparation of the messages.</p>
            
            
      <h2>Matching protocols to channels</h2>
            
      
<p>MPS imposes no restriction on the type of messages that can be sent down a 
  particular channel, so you must ensure that the protocol for the rendered message 
  is compatible with the delivery mechanism.</p>
             
      <p>In the example servlet included with MPS there is a default implementation of the <span class="code">MessageRecipientInfo</span> class to assign messages to channels using the <span class="uicontrol">Preferred message protocol</span> value obtained from the MCS device repository.</p>
            
      <p>A list of relevant message protocol attibutes used by MCS is available in the Messages Category on the Policies tab in the Device policy editor in Eclipse, including the <span class="uicontrol">Preferred message protocol</span> values.</p>
           
            
        
        
            
      <h2>Application-side interface</h2>
            
      <p>The application-side interface allows applications to
                request that messages should be assembled and
                (optionally) submitted for delivery, by passing or
                referencing a device-independent message template in
                the form of an XDIME document.</p>
        
        
            
      <h2>Message assembly interface</h2>
            
      <p>The message assembly API accepts the following parameters:</p>
            
      <ul>
                
         <li>A reference to (by local URL) the canvas to be
                    rendered</li>
               
                
         <li>The destination address(es)</li>
                
         <li>For each addressee, the name of the device (or
                    device type)</li>
                
         <li>The subject header and any other headers required</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p>The message assembly mechanism generates the following types of object on the supported protocols, including attachments in MMS messages:</p>
                
      <ul>
             
         <li>Text: SMS</li>
                
         <li>URL: WAP push</li>
                
         <li>Multipart MIME: MMS, SMTP</li>
            
      </ul>
                
      <p>In order to do this, the message
                assembly mechanism performs several basic tasks.</p>
            
      <ul>
                
         <li>Determine the device type for each recipient, using an external source (unless the device type is specified in the request)</li>
                
         <li>For each device type in the recipient list, one
                    instance of the message is generated as follows:<ul>
                        
               <li>Render the markup for the message in the
                            required protocol</li>
                        
               <li>Retrieve all the required assets</li>
                        
               <li>Encode the asset content</li>
                        
               <li>Assemble the generated pages and related
                            objects into a single multipart message</li>
                        
               <li>Ensure that all internal and external URL
                            references are correctly specified </li>
                        
               <li>If the message exceeds the maximum size
                            accepted by the target device, and it
                            cannot be reduced by resizing any
                            convertible images, the assembly will fail.The following limits apply:
                            
                            <p>SMS: limited to 160 single-byte characters.<br/>
MMS: the value in the <span class="code">Max MMS message size</span> attribute.<br/> 
MHTML: no limit is enforced.<br/>
WAP push: no limit enforced at message preparation time. Dissection is available to limit the page size when the content is requested by the device. The subject (which includes the URL) is limited by SMS message capacity.</p>
               </li>
                    
            </ul>
                
         </li>
                
         <li>When delivery has been requested, the delivery
                    agent is determined, and each message instance
                    submitted</li>
                
         <li>When delivery has not been requested, the message
                    instances are returned, along with the recipient
                    lists</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p>The protocols supported for address modes are:</p>
            
      <ul>
             
         <li>To: SMS/WAP push, SMTP, MMS</li>
                
         <li>Cc: SMTP</li>
                
         <li>Bcc: SMTP</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			Owing to an issue with modes in the the JavaMail API, recipients of SMTP messages may recieve mail that was not intended for them. If all the recipients have the same device, mode information is sent correctly. However, if the recipients have different devices, the message sent does not contain the mode information, and all recipients see the message regardless of the device they are using, and some recipients may receive the message multiple times. Therefore, it is recommended you use the SMTP channel adapter to either send messages to a single recipient (if the message is personalized), or to a list using Bcc addressing.</p>
        
        
            
      <h2>Delivery-side interface</h2>
            
      <p>The delivery-side interface provides:</p>
               
      <ul>
            
         <li>An SMTP interface for submitting MMS and MHTML messages
                with the following features:
            <ul>
                
               <li>Support for headers including extension 'X-'
                    headers</li>
                
               <li>Support for multipart/related MIME-encoded
                    message bodies</li>
               
                
               <li>Optional SMTP authentication with individual
                    credentials for each SMTP server</li>
                
            
            </ul>
         </li>
             
         <li>Support for SMS
                
             <ul>
               <li>Suported primarily as a fallback to allow some message to be delivered to the recipient</li>
               <li>SMPP is supported using the Logica SMPP APIs</li>
            
               <li>SMS messages are limited to 160 characters and should be contained in a text-only pane.</li>
             
            </ul>
         </li>
                
         <li>Support for MMSC API (Nokia)</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p>Delivery-side support is also available for WAP push. See <em>Messaging with WAP push</em> for details.</p>
        
        
            
      <h2>Address-to-device mapping interface</h2>
            
      <p>MPS can perform address-to-device mapping in situations
                where the content provider making the request via the
                message assembly API does not know the device type for
                each user. In this case MPS uses an external mechanism
                to determine the device type for each recipient in
                order to provide the device-target version of the message.</p>
            
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			MPS only provides interfaces; the logic
                to provide values for these interfaces must be
                supplied by the developer</p>
            
      <p>The two main information sources that carriers can use
                to provide the mapping from address to device type are:</p>
            
      <ul>
                
         <li>Mobile subscriber database, typically accessed
                    through LDAP</li>
                
         <li>Mobile network APIs, for example using
                    JAIN/Parlay</li>
            
      </ul>
            
      <p>In some cases, a carrier will wish to use a combination
                of these two sources, for example trying a network API
                first and then a subscriber database if the device is
                not currently connected to the network.</p>
            
      <p>This interface will call other services to get the
                required information. However, the service APIs will
                often vary from one carrier to another. MPS therefore
                includes a generic interface that can be used to
                invoke implementation-specific code in order to
                perform a mapping from addresses to device types.
                Implementation-specific code can be developed and
                installed by the product supplier.</p>
                
      <p>The class <span class="code">com.volantis.mps.recipient.DefaultRecipientResolver</span> that implements this interface can be configured in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file. See <em>Configuring MPS</em> for more information.</p>
