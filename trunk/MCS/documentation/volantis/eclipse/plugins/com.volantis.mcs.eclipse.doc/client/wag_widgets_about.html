      <p>Framework Client provides developers with a simple, standards-compliant authoring
         environment. Control over widget behavior and transitions is available as either policy
         theme properties or as attributes on markup. In this section authors can find all the
         information needed to create graphically appealing client applications with more
         client-side interactivity than standard mobile browser applications are able to provide.</p>
      <p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: Some widgets support transitions, such as sliding, fade in, etc. See the
            <em>About transitions</em> section for details.</p>
      
         <h2>Fallback styling</h2>
         <p>It was mentioned that if the device does not support the Framework Client, the
            server-side processing of the XDIME 2 widget provides an alternative static rendering
            that assures the basic function for which the widget was designed. In addition, the
            XDIME 2 authors can control fallback styling with normal HTML mechanisms â€“ for example
            by putting a widget in a <span class="code">div</span> element. Please see the <em>Fallback styling</em> section for details.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Actions and responses</h2>
         <p>Many widgets are active, in that they are able to load or refresh their content or
            status. These actions are implemented using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX).</p>
         <p>You use the XDIME response vocabulary to provide data for widgets. You should always use
            this vocabulary; any other approach might result in unexpected behavior. Refer to <em>Widget response structure</em> for more information.</p>
         <p>You can allow users to suspend content polling through a provided JavaScript API, but be
            note that it affects only automatic interval-based polling. Polling triggered by the
            user or JavaScript API is not affected. See <em>JavaScript support</em> for
            details.</p>
