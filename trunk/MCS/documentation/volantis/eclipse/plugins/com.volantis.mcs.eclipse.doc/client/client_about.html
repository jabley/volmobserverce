      <p>The Client Framework is a platform that you can use to create XDIME 2 applications with a
         rich client-side user interface, for a wide range of devices. The client side of Client
         Framework is targeted for the Opera 8.6 and higher, Nokia OSS browser for S60 DP3 phones,
         Access NetFront browser v3.4, Firefox, Safari 2.0, and Microsoft Internet Explorer 6.0 and
         higher.</p>
      <p>The Client Framework consists of two parts. On the server side, you use a combination of
         XDIME 2 markup and policy values to access the widget functions. In addition, you can
         include JavaScript in your markup to invoke functions in the client library. On the client
         side, a widget library consists of JavaScript that implements the functions.</p>
      <p>You can use extensions to XDIME 2 markup to specify widgets, and control their behavior and
         transitions using either theme policies, the <span class="code">style</span> element, or style
         attributes on the markup. Examples include folding items, ticker-tape, progress bars,
         popups and carousels.</p>
      <p>The widget elements will help you develop applications that draw the user's attention, and
         apply appealing transitions when users switch from one item to the next.</p>
      <p>The Client Framework package is installed automatically by the MCS installer. So it can be
         accessed over HTTP, in the same way as the rest of the default MCS web application.</p>
      
         <h2>Non-client fallback</h2>
         <p>If the device does not support the Framework Client, the server-side processing of the
            XDIME 2 widget provides an static rendering that assures the basic widget functions.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Sample application</h2>
         <p>The MCS distribution contains a sample Client Framework application that demonstrates
            the use of all of the widgets and transition effects. The project contains all the MCS
            policies and pages of the application. It is located in the
               <span class="filepath">/webapps/mcs/projects/client-app</span> directory.</p>
