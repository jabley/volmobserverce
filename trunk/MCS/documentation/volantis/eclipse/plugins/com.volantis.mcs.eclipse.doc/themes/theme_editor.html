      <p>The Theme editor has two pages, an Overview page listing the theme
         variants and their general attributes, and a Design page where you can
         specify your style selectors and define style properties.</p>
      
         <h2>Overview page</h2>
         <p>The Attributes section contains the <span class="uicontrol">Device category
               scheme</span> control, which you can use to associate an
            existing device category scheme or a custom scheme with the policy.
            For more information on using a custom scheme, refer to <em>Custom device policies</em>. The
               <span class="command">Lock</span> and <span class="command">Unlock</span> buttons are
            displayed if this is a collaborative project. If you use them, the
            action applies to this policy attribute.</p>
         <p>Any variants that you have added to a theme are listed in the
            Variants section. You can add and remove variants at any time. The
               <span class="command">Lock</span> and <span class="command">Unlock</span> buttons
            apply to the selected variant or variants.</p>
         <p>You use the Variant Selection Criteria section to define which
            variant is selected for use on a particular device. If the variant
            is targeted, you can choose a combination of targets from the device
            tree and a single set of devices in a custom category scheme.</p>
         <p>In the Variant Content section, there are options to set a
               <span class="uicontrol">Null variant</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Import a
               parent theme variant</span>. </p>
      
      
         <h2>Selectors</h2>
         <p>On the Design page, you can define the style rules for a theme
            variant. Style rules have a selector and a set of style properties
            that define the page theme.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Style properties</h2>
         <p>You can choose style categories or sub-categories for the current
            selection in the Selectors section from the category tree.</p>
         <p>When you make a selection in the tree, you can edit the property
            values. The number and type of edit controls depend on the category
            you have selected.</p>
         <p>Style properties include:</p>
         <ul>
            <li>font families, and their weight and color</li>
            <li>borders with their style and width</li>
            <li>lists with their numbering options</li>
            <li>table cells and their padding and background color</li>
         </ul>
         <p>Refer to <em>Style property categories</em> for full details.</p>
