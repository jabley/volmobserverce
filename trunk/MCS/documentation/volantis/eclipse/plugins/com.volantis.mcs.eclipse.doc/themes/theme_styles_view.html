      <p>The Style Rules view provides an alternative way to view all
         the rules for a particular theme variant. It contains a table
         that displays the style rules, organised by selector
         sequence, showing:</p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Property</dt>
         <dd>Top level  selector sequences defined for the theme variant. When you expand a sequence the table displays the child style property nodes.</dd>
         <dt>Value</dt>
         <dd>The value of the style property as it appears in the theme editor</dd>
         <dt>Importance</dt>
         <dd>An icon where the style property value is set to !important</dd>
         <dt>Validation status</dt>
         <dd>An icon on rows where the selector sequence or style property values have a validation message</dd>
         
         
      </dl>
        <p><img src="../graphics/mcs_theme_style_rules_view_ui.png" alt="Theme New Style Rule" title="Theme New Style Rule"/></p>
      <p>You can change the width of columns, select rows and scroll
         the list in both directions. When you select a row in the view, the Theme editor selection moves to the Design page and the related selector. If you have selected a property, the property is expanded and the property control in that section is selected.</p>
         <p>You can cut, copy, paste and delete both entire rules and individual properties elsewhere in this variant, or to another variant in this or any other theme. However, you must use the Design page to create or modify rules in any other way.</p>
