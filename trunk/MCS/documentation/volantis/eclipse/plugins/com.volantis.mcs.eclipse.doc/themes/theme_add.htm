<h1>Adding a theme</h1>
<p>You can use the New Theme wizard to create device themes. The wizard allows 
  you to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define a theme name and its location in your project folders</li>
  <li>Select a device to which the theme applies</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naming a theme</h2>
<p>The first page allows you to locate and name the theme. Each theme is a file 
  in your project. The focus will initially be on the <span class="uicontrol">Theme</span> 
  text box, and the policy tree view will be synchronized with your current project 
  folder selection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the <a href="../mcs/mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="New Theme wizard">New 
    Theme wizard</a>.</li>
  <li>Enter a name in the <span class="uicontrol">Theme</span> text box.</li>
  <li>Choose a folder in the policy tree view or enter the full path from the 
    project folder in the first text box.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span> and <a href="../devices/device_choose.htm" title="choose a device">choose 
    a device</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p> The new theme icon is displayed in the policy tree, and a Theme editor tab is opened and highlighted.</p>
<h2>Defining theme attributes</h2>
<p>The Theme editor has two pages, Overview and Design. To change pages, click 
  one of the tabs at the bottom left of the editor.</p>
<p>On the Overview page you'll see a list of the devices you selected for this 
  theme. You can add new devices or remove them at any time using the <span class="command">Add</span> 
  or <span class="command">Remove</span> buttons.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the device list, select a device name.</li>
  <li>If you want to use an existing style sheet instead of editing style rules, 
    enter the URL for the external Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) file.</li>
</ol>
