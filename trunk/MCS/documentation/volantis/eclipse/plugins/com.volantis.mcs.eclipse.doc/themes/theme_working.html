<h1>Working with themes</h1>
<p>You can define theme policies for individual devices and groups of devices. 
  A theme is made up of a set of style rules, and each rule is identified by a 
  selector, and has a set of properties.</p>
  <p>You can  also build up complex themes, which share core branding styles specified at a higher level and adjust these at a device family or specific device level.</p>
<p>To develop a theme in MCS you have to compete the following tasks:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Add a theme</strong> policy to your project using the New Theme 
    wizard</li>
  <li>Using the Theme editor, <strong>choose a device</strong> or devices to associate 
    with your theme</li>
  <li><strong>Add selectors</strong> to the theme and assign <strong>style properties</strong> 
    to them</li>
</ol>
