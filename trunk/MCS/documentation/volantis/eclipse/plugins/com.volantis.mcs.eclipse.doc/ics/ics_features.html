        <p>The ICS servlet can convert images to a different format and pixel
            depth, reduce the color depth for a smaller color palette,
            and scale images. In addition to these features, you can
            specify the desired size of the target image which will
            have a potential bearing on all these factors, as well as
            general compression if applicable.</p>
        
            <h2>Color depth conversion</h2>
            <p>ICS adapts the color representation used in the output
                image to the output file type, and the device's
                display capabilities, using rules in the device
                repository. The color depth and image type
                combinations supported for output images are shown in
                    <em>ICS image formats</em>. For conversion rules see <em>ICS transcoding rules</em>.
            </p>
        
        
            <h2>Image optimization</h2>
            <p>When the color gamut has to be reduced from the input
                to the output images, the algorithms used are
                configurable to the extent available.</p>
            <p>Different palette selection strategies and dithering
                algorithms typically provide different levels of
                visual quality, but exhibit trade-offs against speed
                and image size. A choice of palette selection
                algorithms and dithering algorithms/levels is
                provided. The algorithms used are configurable on a
                per-server basis but can be overridden via URL parameters.</p>
            <p>If too small a restriction is given for a given output
                format (there tends to be a fixed file content
                overhead for image file formats below which sizes
                can't be generated) then the size restriction cannot
                be applied. It is likely in this case that the
                smallest possible image will be generated (for example 1x1
                pixel black and white).</p>
        
        
            <h2>Image scaling</h2>
            <p>The dimensions of the output image are scaled to the size required for the device.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Images are scaled based on width and height. No change
                    in the aspect ratio occurs.</li>
                <li>The scaling algorithm minimizes scaling artifacts</li>
                <li>By default, the transcoder does not make images
                    larger than the source image. However, this
                    setting is configurable and is capable of being
                    overridden with URL parameters.</li>
               <li>In the Eclipse interface, users can minimize the effects of scaling wide images by specifying the left and right width limits of an area to preserve. Vertical cropping is not supported</li>
                <li>Format preservation, if the image is in a format supported by a device, and the size matches the requested size.</li>
            </ul>
        
        
            <h2>Image file size restriction</h2>
            <p>The transcoding engine is able to limit the output file
                to a size that can be handled by the device. This
                parameter is obtained from the device repository and
                can be provided via the request URL.</p>
            <p>The file size restriction has the following properties:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> It is guaranteed not to produce an image that is
                    larger than requested. If a viable image cannot be
                    produced within the specified size then the
                    alternative text is displayed.</li>
                <li> For file formats that use lossless or no
                    compression, the file size reduction strategy is
                    to shrink the pixel dimensions of the image. This
                    applies to true color PNG, WBMP and BMP output.</li>
                <li>For file formats that use lossy, variable
                    compression, the initial file size reduction
                    strategy is to increase the compression factor.
                    However, there is a maximum compression threshold,
                    above which pixel dimension reduction is used.
                    This maximum threshold has a default value that is
                    configurable at the server level, but this value
                    is capable of being overridden via a URL
                    parameter. This applies to JFIF/JPEG output.</li>
                <li> For indexed (palette-based) file formats, the
                    initial strategy is to reduce the palette size and
                    therefore the effective bit depth of the image.
                    However, there is a minimum palleted size
                    threshold, below which pixel dimension reduction
                    is used instead. This minimum threshold has a
                    default value that is configurable at the server
                    level, but this value is capable of being
                    overridden via a URL parameter. This applies to
                    indexed PNG output.</li>
