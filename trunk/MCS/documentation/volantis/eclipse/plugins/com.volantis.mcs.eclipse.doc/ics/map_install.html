      <p>Media Access Proxy (MAP) has a separate installer. However, there is an option in the MCS installer to set the URL of the MAP web application. After MAP is installed you should review the features of the ICS servlet, and configure the parameter and log settings as required.
      </p>   
      
         <h2>Required software</h2>
         <p>MAP requires a JNDI datasource to be configured in your application
            server. To enable caching of transcoded assets, you should install
            the Squid Internet Object Cache server. You can obtain Squid from
               <span class="code">http://www.squid-cache.org/</span>.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Install options</h2>
         <p>The Image Conversion Service (ICS) can transcode images between
            various image formats. It can also perform scaling and watermarking
            operations. It is recommended that this be installed. Installation
            of this module will also install a servlet that allows MAP to behave
            like earlier versions of ICS.</p>
         <p>A simple plugin service that just returns the request URL.</p>
         <p>The Standard Transcoder Service (STI) plugin allows MAP to convert
            simple GET requests into complex STI requests that can be directed
            to a specified STI provider.</p>
      
     
      
         <h2>Running the installer</h2>
         <p>The installation wizard steps you through a series of pages. Most of
            the installer values have defaults. When you have completed a
            section, click <span class="command">Next</span> to move to the next page, or
            click <span class="command">Previous</span> to review or modify any values.</p>
         <p>The installer uses the entries to write to the related section of
            the configuration file. You can edit this file at any time after
            installation if you need to change the settings.</p>
         <p>The following steps assume that you have selected all the install
            options.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Choose the <span class="uicontrol">Accept</span> option to accept the
               license agreement</li>
            <li>Select the required install packs</li>
           <li>On the next page, accept the default server
               <span class="uicontrol">URL</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Port</span> values
               or enter new settings</li>
            <li>Oprtionally add a <span class="uicontrol">Watermark URL</span></li>
            <li>Accept the <span class="uicontrol">In memory IO buffering</span> and
                  I<span class="uicontrol">CS native mode</span> settings</li>
            <li>Enter an <span class="uicontrol">Originator ID</span> and <span class="uicontrol">STI
                  service URL</span></li>
            <li>Accept the default installation directory or choose an alternate
               location</li>
            <li>The installer displays a summary of all installation choices.
               Use the <span class="command">Previous</span> button to go back and change
               any options. When you are satisfied with all your choices, click
                  <span class="command">Install</span> to start the installation, and
                  <span class="command">Quit</span> to close the installer.</li>
            <li>Copy the <span class="filepath">[install_directory]/webapps/map</span>
               directory to your web application server.</li>
            <li>Follow the instructions in <em>Configuring MAP</em></li>
         </ol>
      
      
         <h2>Testing your installation</h2>
         <p>Now test that MAP has been properly installed by converting a
               <span class="filepath">.gif</span> image.</p>
