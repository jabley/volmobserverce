      <p>The following is a summary of the changes to features and
         functionality in MCS 3.5.1. Further information and details
         about existing functionality and features may be found in
         previous release notes and documentation.</p>
      <p>You should also refer to the notes in <em>MCS Supported platforms</em> and <em>Changes to the API</em>.</p>
      
         <h2>XDIME 2</h2>
         <p>XDIME 2 is a new version of XDIME that adds elements from
            the XHTML 2 namespace to those already available in
            XDIME-CP. XDIME-CP is thus a subset of both XDIME and
            XDIME 2 for use by content providers who plan to supply
            pages to carrier partners for configuration in content
            adaptation environments.</p>
         <p>XDIME 2 is not yet functionally equivalent to XDIME. At
            present, bindings to layouts and themes are available
            using the <span class="code">link</span> element, and it is
            possible to override text links on fragments using the
               <span class="code">meta</span> element, and on form fragments
            using the new <span class="code">xf:group</span> tag in layouts.
            Additional elements and functionality will be
            progressively added in future releases.</p>
      
      
      
         <h2>Changes to the Eclipse policy interface</h2>
         <p>There are several changes to the policy editor interfaces.</p>
         <ul>
            <li>The term 'variant' replaces 'asset', device layout'
               and 'device theme' in the interface labels.</li>
            <li>In component, layout and theme editors you can choose
               the name of a custom device policy to target a variant
               or variants at specific devices. When you choose the
               policy name, the set of custom values you specified is
               available for selection to target those devices.</li>
            <li>A project on any user's machine can be configured for
               collaborative working when it is created. A database
               stores the policies, and the database policies are
               downloaded and refreshed automatically in the Eclipse
               workbench. The configuration supports individual user
               locks on entire policies or selected policy variants,
               and users can see the current status in a Locks view.</li>
            <li/>
            <li>New pseudo-element selectors
               <span class="code">::mcs-previous</span>, <span class="code">::mcs-next</span>
               and <span class="code">::mcs-reset</span>, and new properties on
               presentation elements have been added to support
               fragmentation overrides.</li>
            <li>A Style Rules view provides an alternative way to view
               all the rules for a particular theme variant. It
               contains a table that displays the style rules,
               organized by selector sequence, showing validation
               status, importance, name and property value.</li>
         </ul>
      
      
         <h2>Remote projects</h2>
         <p>You can now develop MCS projects remotely in the Eclipse
            workbench and deploy them on a policy server using a
            secure connection. </p>
         <p>MCS can host multiple Secure Publishing Server (SPS)
            instances using a Secure Connection Server (SCS) as an
            HTTP proxy server for a host MCS service. It supports the
            proxying of both HTTP and HTTPS requests, and maintains a
            list of HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 connections and the associated
            URLs.</p>
         <p>An <span class="code">http-proxy</span> element is added to the
               <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Named projects</h2>
         <p>You can override the settings for the default project by
            placing an <span class="filepath">mcs-project.xml</span> file
            either in the same directory as an XDIME page being
            processed, or somewhere on the path to it. MCS will
            traverse the directory hierarchy to the context root of
            your web application to find a file with this name, and if
            it fails to find one, it will use the URI and variant
            values in the <span class="code">default</span> element.</p>
      
      
         <h2>XDIME form elements</h2>
         <p>You can upload binary assets to a form using the XDIME
               <span class="code">xfupload</span> element. The element only
            results in markup on HTML based protocols.</p>
         <p>WML does support file upload. Using the xfupload element
            may cause some WML browsers to show an error when the page
            is processed.</p>
      
      
      
         <h2>WML protocol configuration</h2>
         <p>The <span class="code">input-dollars</span> attribute on the
               <span class="code">wml</span> element in the MCS configuration
            schema is obsolete and has been removed. MCS now processes
            WML in the 'variable' mode.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Configuration schema changes</h2>
         <p>The configuration schema also changes in the following
            ways.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Variant (asset) caches are no longer supported. MCS
               now caches the whole policy and all information derived
               from that policy, for example the best variant for a
               specific device, using a single cache entry. You should
               therefore re-calculate the optimal size of your caches.</li>
            <li>The plugin attribute, policy preference and URL caches
               are no longer used and have been removed</li>
            <li>There is now only a single remote cache, rather than
               one for each policy type. It is therefore no longer
               possible to associate different default caching
               properties and quotas with individual policy
            types.</li>
         </ol>
      
      
         <h2>Caching database policies</h2>
<p>A performance improvement has been made to cache locking. It prevents the possibility 
  of blocked access to cached policies in a JDBC database.</p>
<h2>API change</h2>
<p>In addition to other API changes noted for this release, the <span class="code">elementDirect</span> 
  method in the <span class="code">DeprecatedPAPIElement</span> interface, allows 
  you to write literals to the output, without character encoding.</p>
<h2>Policy migration note</h2>
<p>The 2.9 to 3.0 Migration tool applies DTD/Schema validation to local policies 
  as they are read. If the policy fails validation, an erro will be generated 
  and that policy will be ignored. </p>
<p>This behaviour matches that of the 2.9 Runtime. So, any local policieswhich 
  fail to migrate from 2.9 because they are invalid and should not have been usable 
  in the 2.9 runtime. This in turns means that they shouldnot be in current use 
  in any website generated by MCS 2.9. These policies should either be modified 
  by hand to be valid, or discarded if no longer in use.</p>
<p>For example, a 2.9 image policy containing &lt;deviceImageAsset ...encoding=&quot;png&quot; 
  ... &gt; will not be valid according to the DTD and will fail to migrate as 
  the schema has uppercase PNG instead.</p>


      
      
         <h2>Known issues</h2>
         
            <p>There is a problem with naming
               layout policies. If you try to create a layout in a new
               folder when the layout name already exists somewhere
               else in project, under a different folder then you get
               the error "The policy [layout_name] already exists".</p>
            <p>When using ICS from DSB you need
               to use the
               <span class="code">pipeline:convertImageURLToDMS</span>
               element in transforce emulation mode.</p>
            <p>In an <span class="code">xfform</span>
               element, if neither the <span class="code">captionPane</span> nor
                  <span class="code">entryPane</span> attributes are set, instead
               of the element being output in the default pane,
               nothing is rendered.</p>
            <p>In the Type Allocation Codes
               section of device editor, you may encounter display
               problems when expanding or contracting the section.</p>
            <p>Remote asset groups will not work
               when referenced from image components, and the asset
               group is always assumed to be local to the project.</p>
            <p>On WebSphere Everyplace Mobile
               Portal 5.1, when the ICS is configured to access a
               remote image server, or when v.imgHost and v.imgPort
               are used in the URL, and a requested image is PNG then
               ICS returns a 404 error.</p>
            <p>On WMLC devices,
               <span class="code">accesskey</span> attribute values set on
                  <span class="code">a</span> elements do not render
               correctly.</p>
            <p>In the layout editor you cannot
               drag and drop dissecting pane formats. You should use
               cut and paste.</p>
            <p>In collaborative working projects
               you cannot save rollover images when save when not
               holding the lock, even if it appears to be allowed.
               Attempting to do so will result in an error, but the
               save will not be carried out.</p>
            <p>You may see visual artifacts on
               importing JDBC polices to a collaborative project</p>
            <p>Double-click does not focus asset
               type. You should select the asset type manually.</p>
            <p>The image variant wizard does not
               show the Device Category tab for targeted devices. You
               should assign device categories once the variant has
               been created. Specific devices can still be defined
               with the wizard.</p>
            <p>You may get an exception opening
               the Style Rules View If this occurs, closing and
               re-opening the View should resolve the problem.</p>
           
            <p>All policies are incorrectly
               referred to as themes in the alerts/actions section of
               the asset group editor. You can be safely ignore this
               issue.</p>
            <p>Opening a layout and selecting a
               variant incorrectly marks the layout as changed. If no
               changes have been made to the file then you can closed
               without saving.</p>
           
            <p>You cannot target a variant in
               some wizards. You should assign target
               devices/categories for layouts once they have been
               created.</p>
            <p>Some commands when creating Layout
               should not be visible and actions have no effect.</p>
            <p>Incorrect markup is generated for
               Windows WMA sound files.</p>
            <p>mcsImport -merge option is fails
               with a Postgres database. You should therefore not
               merge databases - instead export the database, edit it
               and import into an new or cleared database.</p>
            <p>The <span class="code">directory</span>
               attribute on the <span class="code">debug-output</span>
               element in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file
               specifies the output directory location. A trailing
               slash in this value is not significant, and the
               location is assumed to be a directory in which the
               debug files will be created.</p>
            <p>The WML protocol does not render
               whitespace correctly in the following cases:</p>
            <ul>
               <li>A page that contains a
                  <span class="code">dividehint</span> element and does not
                  require dissection causes a <span class="code">p</span>
                  element with an empty space to be rendered</li>
               <li>A <span class="code">p</span> element with a
                  <span class="code">pane</span> attribute and a preceding
                     <span class="code">p</span> element will not be merged
                  even though their styles would allow it.</li>
               <li>The mode is not being correctly set when a page is
                  rendered as multiple cards due to dissecting panes.
                  It should be explicitly set to the default value if
                  the last paragraph of the previous card specified
                  the non default value.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>ICS does not fall back to use the
               default configuration file in the web application's
                  <span class="filepath">WEB-INF</span> directory. The location
               of the ICS configuration file specified in the
                  <span class="filepath">web.xml</span> file should therefore
               always specify a path to a valid configuration file.</p>
            <p>Montage layouts should not be used
               in this release</p>
            <p>In some environments, a
               SQLException may thrown when connecting to DB2 when
               requesting a JSP page for the first time after a
               restart. Subsequent requests are processed correctly.
               It may be possible to resolve the problem by changing
               the DB2 driver.</p>
            <p>If a device accepts WMLC but uses
               XHTML, then XDIME pages are not cached.</p>
            <p>MCS currently supports the jconn2
               database driver for Sybase, which cannot fetch values
               of columns &gt;256 characters. As a result values in wider
               columns may be cut.</p>
            <p>If the web driver connection
               timeout in the mcs-config.xml file is specified as -1
               and the global timeout is set, then the global timeout
               is applied to the web driver connection.</p>
            <p>Empty policy names such as
                  <span class="code"> &lt;img src=""&gt; </span> should not
               be used as they will result in an exception.</p>
            <p>Alternative text not shown in jsp
               page and multimedia components.</p>
