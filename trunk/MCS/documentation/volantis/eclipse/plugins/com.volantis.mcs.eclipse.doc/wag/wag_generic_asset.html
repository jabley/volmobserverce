      <h1>Generic assets</h1>
      
      <p>You should consider using generic variants in an MCS component
         when you have a large number of variants to identify for
         particular devices, and the cost of doing so at design time
         is high.</p>
      
      <p>MCS searches for a variant with properties that make it
         suitable. For audio variants, for example, the decision is
         based on how the audio data is encoded. With images,
         encoding, pixel depth, rendering and image size are all used.</p>
      
         
      <h2>Image variants</h2>
         
      <ol>
            
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">Encoding</span> must be supported by
               the device</li>
            
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">Width in Pixels</span>, or
                  <span class="uicontrol">Width Hint</span> percent in pixels,
               must be no wider than device width</li>
            
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">Pixel Depth</span> should be less than
               or equal to that of the device unless <ul>
                  
               <li>
                  <span class="uicontrol">Encoding</span> is BMP, GIF,
                     JPEG or PNG</li>
                  
               <li>No other variant has a pixel depth within the
                     device capability</li>
                  
               <li>The only other image variant has a depth of 1, and
                     the device has a depth greater than 1. This rule
                     favors color and grayscale images where the only
                     alternative is monochrome.</li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
            
         <li>The rendering field of the image variant should match
               that of the device unless<ul>
                  
               <li>
                  <span class="uicontrol">Encoding</span> is one of BMP,
                     GIF, JPEG or PNG</li>
                  
               <li>There is no other variant with a
                        <span class="uicontrol">Rendering</span> that matches
                     the device color capability</li>
               
            </ul>
            
         </li>
            
         <li>When multiple variants are equally applicable the choice
               is made based on the pixel depth<ul>
                  
               <li>If it is &lt;= 8, the preference order is
                     PNG, GIF, JPEG</li>
                  
               <li>If it is &gt; 8, the order is JPEG, PNG,
                  GIF</li>
               
            </ul>
         </li>
         
      </ol>
      
      
         
      <h2>Dynamic visual variants</h2>
         
      <p>MCS treats dynamic visual variants as generic variants. There
            might be several variant files that vary by encoding and
            size. It is also likely that several entries might point
            to the same movie, but specify different sizes. For
            example, Macromedia Flash movies are scalable, so it is
            possible to have multiple variants for different sized
            movies to be sent to devices with different sized screens.</p>
         
      <ol>
            
         <li>
            <span class="uicontrol">Encoding</span> must be supported by
               the device</li>
            
         <li>Ideally, the <span class="uicontrol">Width</span> of the
               dynamic visual should be no larger than the width of
               the device. So MCS will use a smaller variant if it is
               available.</li>
            
         <li>If there is no visual smaller than the device width,
               MCS will use the smallest available instead.</li>
         
      </ol>
