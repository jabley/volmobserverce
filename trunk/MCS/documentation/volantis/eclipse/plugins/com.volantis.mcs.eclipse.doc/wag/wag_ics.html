      <p>MCS can use the Image Conversion Service (ICS) to convert
         image variants by transforming the size, encoding and color
         depth to make the resulting variant suitable for a target
         device.</p>
      
         <h2>Defining convertible variants</h2>
         <p>You define convertible image variants in the Image
            component editor. MCS uses the image as the basis for a
            real-time transformation operation that optimizes it for
            use with a specific device. For example, a request from a
            WAP phone might be satisfied by transforming a large,
            color JPEG image into a small, WBMP image.</p>
         <p><img src="../graphics/image_asset_ui.png" alt="Image asset attributes" title="Image asset attributes"/></p>
         <p>You can choose only one convertible image variant for a
            given image component by setting the <span class="uicontrol">Conversion mode</span> to 'Always convert'. If you have also chosen a device
            specific variant MCS will process it first. If the
            convertible variant cannot be used for the current device,
            then MCS will process any generic variant you have
            defined.</p>
         <p>When the transformation involves a change of image size,
            ICS maintains the aspect ratio, and scales it using the
           <span class="uicontrol">Width</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Height</span> attribute values.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can specify width alone, but if you define a height value, you must also provide a width setting.</div>
      
      
         <h2>Specifying image cropping</h2>
         <p>If you have a wide but shallow convertible image, like a
            banner that will scale badly to a small screen, you can
            specify values that will have the effect of cropping an
            image area to preserve - before the scaling operation
            takes place (you cannot crop vertically).</p>
         <p>You can set inclusive values for the left and right pixels
            of the area to preserve on the <em>original image</em>,
            using the <span class="uicontrol">May crop before</span> and
               <span class="uicontrol">May crop after</span> controls. The
            pixels are counted from the left of the image and start at
            0.</p>
         <p>For example, if your company logo occupies the leftmost
            130 pixels of a banner, you can set the
               <span class="uicontrol">May crop after</span> value to 129. If
            necessary, ICS will crop the image to the right of this
            vertical line, before scaling it to fit the device screen
            width. If you do not set either value the image will be
            scaled without cropping. Vertical cropping is not supported.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Referring to convertible images in XDIME</h2>
         <p>In XDIME, you can refer to images using the
            <span class="code">img</span> or <span class="code">logo</span>
            elements. Both elements can take one of three attributes
            to name a component or specify a URL.</p>
         <p>You should use the <span class="code">src</span> attribute to name a
            component containing a convertible image variant. To locate an image on
            the file system use the <span class="code">url</span> attribute. If you
            use the <span class="code">urlc</span> attribute, MCS locates a
            convertible image file (as distinct from a component name)
            to be used for transcoding.</p>
         
      
      <h2>Enabling transcoding in CSS</h2>
         <p>You can also use the CSS function <span class="code">mcs-transcodeable-url()</span> to allow rewriting of background and list item image URLs for ICS. This function uses the asset transcoder to rewrite the URL, for example by adding a transcoding rule and the necessary transcoding parameters. It does not provide an alternative text if the image cannot be loaded.</p>
         <pre class="code">background-color: #FFFCCC
background-image: mcs-transcodeable-url('http://localhost:8080/image.gif')</pre>
