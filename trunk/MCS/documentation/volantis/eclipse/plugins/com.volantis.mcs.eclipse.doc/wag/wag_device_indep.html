      <h1>Device independence and MCS</h1>
      
      <p>Over several years the number of different devices that can
         access the web has increased, with a corresponding change in
         the range of their capabilities. Not only do devices differ
         in physical characteristics, they can also differ in the
         protocols that they support. Bandwidth has improved, the
         range of access paths has been extended, and user
         expectations have kept pace with this change.</p>
      
      <p>It no longer makes practical or business sense for publishers
         and content providers to develop material for a single
         channel or technology. Rich content and applications now need
         to be delivered to a range of devices with a minimum of
         effort.</p>
      
      <p>A delivery context is a set of device properties that defines
         a delivery environment, and can be used to provide
         information in a format and style that match the capabilities
         of the device. MCS handles a range of delivery contexts by
         selecting or adapting the content to match a particular
         device profile. As an author, you create content once, and
         then tailor it to different devices using a combination of
         layout and style. This means making a clear distinction
         between device dependent and device independent information
         by separating it into several parts.</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         
  <li> <strong>Content</strong> may be static information, or dynamic data retrieved 
    from an external source in response to an query. In MCS you use XDIME markup, 
    an XML vocabulary that is in many ways similar to HTML and WML. In addition, 
    XDIME has a number of special elements to support device independent content, 
    and the inclusion of dynamic datasources.</li>
  <li>MCS manages the relationship between device-independent content and device-dependent 
    data by using <strong>components</strong> and <strong>variants</strong>. For 
    example, an image component can refer to a set of image files, or variants, 
    that individually fit the profiles of several different devices. The attributes 
    of each variant are contained in the component. In a web page, the img element 
    in the XDIME markup contains the name of the Image component in it's src attribute. 
    When a device requests the page, MCS uses the image attributes to select the 
    best image variant to display on the device.</li>
         
         <li>
            
            <strong>Layouts</strong> contain the device dependent positioning
            for information rendered on a variety of displays, where
            limitations of small devices may require that content be
            split or even omitted</li>
         
         <li>
            
            <strong>Themes</strong> govern the style of a site across multiple
            devices. The thematic information for a device is termed a
            style, and a style contains rules that are appropriate to
            the delivery context.</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>This separation of aspects of site development maps to the
         skills required to build it. Layouts and themes provide the
         presentation layer of the site, allowing content to be
         developed independently.</p>

         independence refer to the W3C <em>Device independence</em> web site.</p>
