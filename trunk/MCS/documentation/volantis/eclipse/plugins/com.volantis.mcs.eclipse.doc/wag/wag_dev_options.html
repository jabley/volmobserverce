      <h1>Development options</h1>
		
      <p>MCS can support individual or team development or a combination of both, so you can plan and manage your development process to suit your existing working practices, organisational structure or application requirements.</p>
		
			
      <h2>Individual development</h2>
		
		
      <p>The separation of policy and device information in MCS means that developers can use a personal, self-contained environment where they have their own XML repository and a local installation of MCS. Development and testing can therefore take place wherever they are located. It is also possible to support a local JDBC installation or to access a remote database.</p>
		
      <p>Self-contained working is a good option for remote, individual or small team development whereby developers work on their own projects and policies, and do not need access to other developerâ€™s resources.</p>
		
		
		
			
      <h2>Team development</h2>
			
      <p>You can also support teams of developers working on policies for a final application. As well as developers who create policies and XDIME markup, it is also possible to have teams of designers who just work on policy development and do not get involved in developing the XDIME applications that will use them. Users with a local XML repository could share their policies with other team members using collaborative working on projects.</p>
			
		
		
      <p>After testing, the finished application or policy updates maybe deployed to a central XML or database repository. It would be more typical to deploy to a database to take advantage of underlying scalability and data sharing capabilities.</p>
		
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: An XML repository is single-user only and is not deployed to shared file systems.</p>
