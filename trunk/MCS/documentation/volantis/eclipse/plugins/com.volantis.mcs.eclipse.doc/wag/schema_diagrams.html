<p>Content model is a term used to describe the set of elements 
  and attributes contained inside another XML element. Although the XML Schema 
  specification is explicit about how schemas should be presented in XML, there 
  is no commonly agreed-upon format for symbols representing information in schema 
  diagrams. Schema editors and viewers have different approaches to diagramming. For 
  the examples in MCS documentation the diagrams use the following conventions.</p>
<p>The diagrams show the structure and cardinality of the elements used 
  in these structures. Attributes are not shown.</p>
<h2>xs:sequence</h2>
<p>In the first figure, the symbol in the center, with the horizontal dotted 
  line, indicates a sequence. This diagram says the <span class="code">select</span> element consists of 
  the sequence of <span class="code">when</span> and <span class="code">otherwise</span> elements. The boxes with a plus (+) at the right indicates that there is hidden content not shown in the diagram. An arrow at the bottom left of an element indicates that it refers to a declaration elsewhere in the schema. 
  The dotted line around the elements indicates they are optional.</p>

<h2>xs:choice or xs:all</h2>
<p>The switchlike symbol in the next figure indicates a choice; in this case, 
  a choice between one or more <span class="code">th</span> or <span class="code">td</span> elements. The solid line around the elements shows that one or other is required.</p>

<p class="caption"><img src="../graphics/choice_cm.png" alt="xs:choice content model" title="xs:choice content model" /></p>
<p>Another way of providing a choice is to use the following structure. The symbol is for the xs:all element that allows the contained 
  elements to occur in any order, either once only or not at all. </p>

<h2>Cardinality</h2>

<p>Cardinality expresses constraints about the minimum and maximum 
  occurrences of elements. The number of times it may appear is given by the text below it. In the final figure 1..âˆž means the <span class="code">minOccurs</span> attribute has a value of 1 and <span class="code">maxOccurs</span> 
  is unbounded (infinity). If there is no such text, the diagram is showing that 
  it can occur only once.</p>
<p>The diagram shows some additional information. The row of bars at the 
  top left of the <span class="code">td</span> and <span class="code">th</span> elements indicates that only text content is allowed.</p>
