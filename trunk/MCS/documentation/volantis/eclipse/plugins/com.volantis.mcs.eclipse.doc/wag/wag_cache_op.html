      <p>The goal of page caching is to improve the performance of MCS, but there are some
         circumstances in which page caching is not advisable. This topic
         outlines the caching operation, discusses some performance issues and
         suggests an approach to setting cache values.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Page caching is not supported for JSPs, WMLC documents
         or portlets.</div>
      
         <h2>Caching operation</h2>
         <p>For the first request for a page, the content caching operation
            caches the results of rendering a page for a particular device,
            fragmentation and dissection state. The cached material is in the
            markup of the target device, not the original XDIME page or any
            results of pipeline operations.</p>
         <p>The source is processed in the usual way to create the output ready
            to be rendered. Rendering for the target device is carried out in
            MCS and the results are cached in addition to being returned to the
            requester.</p>
         <p>If a subsequent request for the same URL in the same fragmentation
            and dissection state from the same type of device is received, the
            document is checked just before rendering. If the XDIME is the same
            as the XDIME that created the cached page, the cached version is
            returned to the requester and rendering is avoided.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Performance</h2>
         <p>For static pages there is a better case for using page caching than
            for pages with content that is known to be dynamic. The dynamic
            content may produce a different cache key for requests from
            identical devices, defeating the goal of caching. Also, the time
            taken to evaluate subsequent requests with complex pipeline
            operations may exceed the potential gain made by not having to
            render the page.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Setting cache values</h2>
         <p>The default value for page caching is set in the
            <span class="code">defaultScope</span> attribute on the
            <span class="code">page-cache</span> element in the
               <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file. The default for the
            default attribute is 'none'. You can override this value, or any
            other default value that has been set, with three possible values
            for  for individual pages. The
            'optimistic' and 'safe' values enable caching for the page, and
            affect the way that MCS calculates a cache key on the content.</p>
         <dl>
            <dt>optimistic</dt>
            <dd>The cache key is calculated on the basic XDIME page, before any
               pipeline processing. Some performance gains will be made, since
               only the basic page forms the key, but there is a risk that
               outdated content will be rendered from the cache. So this setting
               is suited for static pages or simple transform operations in the
               pipeline, when the transform result is predictably consistent. It
               should not be used where the basic page references other
               documents or content sources, unless they are also static.</dd>
            <dt>safe</dt>
            <dd>The cache key is calculated after all pipeline operations. Any
               variations in content owing to external factors will cause
               multiple caches for a given device. This setting is suited to
               situations where, for example, you want to ensure that the most
               recently cached version is served.</dd>
            <dt>none</dt>
            <dd>MCS will never cache the page. Use this setting when security
               and privacy issues make it important that pages are not rendered
               other than for the original request.</dd>
