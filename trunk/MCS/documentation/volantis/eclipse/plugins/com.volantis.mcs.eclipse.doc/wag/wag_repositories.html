      <h1>MCS repositories</h1>
      
      <p>MCS policies are contained in repositories. <strong>Local
            repositories</strong> take two forms.</p>
      
      <ul>
         
         <li>
            
            <p>The <strong>XML repository</strong> contains design time policy
               information. You'll use this repository to design and
               test policies.</p>
            
            <p>Layout, component, theme and device policies are
               automatically implemented as a set of individual XML
               files in a project's contents directory. When you work
               with policies in the Eclipse interface, you
               use wizards or policy editors create or edit XML files
               in the background.</p>
            
            <p>The single-file <strong>device repository</strong> is largely
               maintained from an online device update service. It
               also has an interface for adding any new devices or
               custom device policies required by your
            application.</p>
         
         </li>
         
         <li>For design time collaborative working, or better runtime performance you can use a <strong>JDBC repository</strong>. Collaborative working uses a database so that team members can manage locks on individual poicies or policy variants.  If the database is used only a runtime,
            your system administrator will import all the XML policy
            data for the application into a database when policy development is complete.</li>
      
      </ul>
      
      <p>You can also make use of policy information in a <strong>remote
            repository</strong>. A remote repository contains policy
         information served from a remote server. It can include policies created and maintained in the Eclipse workbench and exported to a remote locatiion, or content from external systems. MCS can be configured to
         access the remote server, and you can use URLs on this server
         in your policies. At runtime, the remote server will retrieve
         the policy information from the URL.</p>
         
      
      <p>A single local repository can contain multiple projects. In
         an XML repository a project is the root directory that
         contains the policies. In a database repository the project
         is part of the primary key to each table. So to retrieve a
         policy from a given project you need to specify the project
         as part of the policy identity.</p>
      
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: MCS has a default project. Policy references that do not
         specify a project will be assumed to belong to it.</p>
