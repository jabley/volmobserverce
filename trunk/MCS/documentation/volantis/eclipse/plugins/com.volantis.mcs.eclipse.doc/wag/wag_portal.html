      <h1>Defining portals</h1>
      
      <p>In MCS, a portal is a canvas with some specific attributes,
         and a region is a format that you define in a layout.</p>
      
      <p>To support portals, MCS provides two distinct kinds of
         canvas. Top-level portal canvasses define complete pages in
         target markup, whereas included portlets define target page
         components only. See <em>Types of canvas</em> for
         details.</p>
      
         
      <h2>Portal layouts</h2>
         
      <p>MCS supports two kinds of layout. Canvas layouts may be
            used for normal canvasses, portals and portlets. Montage
            layouts may not be used with portals.</p>
         
      <p>If you construct a layout used with a portal canvas, you
            need to refer to and include layouts associated with the
            portlets that it includes. You do this by defining a
            Region format. Region formats are designed to contain
            complete layouts. At run time, MCS uses the
            <span class="uicontrol">Name</span> attribute entered in
            the region's Format Attributes view to associate
            the XDIME markup with the region.</p>
         
      <p>Region formats are a little like panes, in that they
            cannot contain any lower level format definitions.
            Instead, they define areas that will contain content laid
            out according to some other layout or layouts.</p>
         
      <p>In the example, the layout is named 'myPortal', so the
            region element refers to 'region1' within
            layout'myPortal'.</p>
         
      <pre class="code">&lt;canvas
   layoutName="/myPortal.mlyt"
   type="portal"&gt;
   &lt;region name="region1"&gt;
      &lt;include href="portletA.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;
   &lt;/region&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
         
      <p>It is possible to include multiple portlets within a
            single region, for example:</p>
         
      <pre class="code">&lt;canvas
   layoutName="/myPortal.mlyt"
   type="portal" ... ...&lt;
   &lt;region name="region1"&gt;
      &lt;include href="portletA.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;
      &lt;include href="portletB.xml" parse="xml"/&gt;
   &lt;/region&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
         
      <p>In this case, both portlet pages are included
            sequentially, which normally causes the second portlet to
            appear below the first within the region. But you cannot
            specify any relative or absolute positioning of portlets
            or inclusions used in this way. To control relative
            positioning, you should use a separate region for each
            portlet or inclusion.</p>
            
      
      
         
      <h2>Portal themes</h2>
         
      <p>Each portal or portlet canvas can be associated with a
            theme that applies to the content in the canvas.</p>
         
      <p>If you do not specify a theme for an included canvas, it
            will inherit its theme from its parent. For portlets, this
            means that they will inherit their theme from the
            enclosing portal. If a portlet has a theme and that theme
            defines a style with the same name as a style in the
            parent, the portlet's style attributes will be added to,
            and merged with, the parent style attributes.</p>
            
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			If you apply themes portlet canvases, they may not render correctly on devices that do not support the CSS functions for descendant selectors based on classes.</p>
      
      
         
      <h2>Missing Regions</h2>
         
      <p>It is quite possible for a region tag to refer to a region
            that does not exist in the portal layout. This situation
            is analogous to that when a page refers to a pane that
            does not exist in its layout. In the case of the missing
            pane, MCS simply ignores content targeted to it and takes
            steps to avoid unnecessary generation of device dependent
            output.</p>
