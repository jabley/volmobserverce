<h1>Identification patterns</h1>
<p>In the Device Repository editor Overview page you can edit one or more primary 
  and secondary identification patterns for a device.</p>
<p>MCS uses the identification patterns at runtime to identify an unknown device. 
  The patterns are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. 
  They can be split into two sets; those that match user agent headers and those 
  that match general headers.</p>

<p>The device that MCS finds using the primary patterns may indicate that there 
  is a more specific device to use. If the the headers of the request contain 
  the secondary header specified in the device profile then MCS will carry out 
  a search of the device patterns using a combination of the header and header 
  value.</p>

<h2>Secondary patterns</h2>
<p>In the Secondary patterns section, you can specify the header or headers that 
  will distinguish between devices that send the same primary pattern, but have 
  differences in the HTTP header. For example, the User Agent Profile (UAProf) 
  URI may be used.</p>
<p>A secondary pattern is made up of three parts; an HTTP header name, an HTTP 
  header value and a device name, shown in three columns in the editor. You enter 
  the secondary pattern information in the <span class="uicontrol">Header name</span> 
  and <span class="userinput">Value</span> columns.</p>
<p>In the <span class="uicontrol">Device Name</span> column you can specify the 
  name of the device that matched the primary pattern. This is useful if more 
  than one device that has the same secondary header, and you only want that device 
  matched if a specific user agent was matched first. </p>
