<h1>Adding a custom policy</h1>
<p>On the Structure page of the Device Repository editor you can provide the definitions 
  for names, type, possible values, and other information that combine to make 
  a device repository policy.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Device tree select Custom as a fallback. MCS enables the <span class="command">New</span> 
    button.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">New</span> to start the New Policy wizard</li>
  <li>Enter a <span class="uicontrol">Short name </span>. Policy names must be 
    unique in a repository, so if you use the name of an existing device you'll 
    see a warning.</li>
  <li>Choose a combination of <span class="uicontrol">Composition</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> 
    for the policy. The options in <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> will change 
    depending on the value in <span class="uicontrol">Composition.</span></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard. MCS displays 
    the values you have entered in the Policy definition section. <span class="uicontrol">Short 
    name</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Composition</span> are read only.</li>
  <li>In the Policy Definition section add a display <span class="uicontrol">Name</span>. 
    MCS also displays this text in the device tree.</li>
  <li>Enter a <span class="uicontrol">Description</span> that will appear as a 
    tool-tip for the policy controls</li>
  <li>Enter or <span class="command">Add</span> the value(s) that you want for 
    the category, If it is a selection you can use the <span class="command">Up</span> 
    or <span class="command">Down</span> buttons to order your list.</li>
  <li>Define policy value(s) in the Master Value section. These may be any value 
    or values specified for the new category.</li>
  <li>Add a <span class="uicontrol">UAProf name</span></li>
</ol>
<p>MCS displays the policy control you have defined the next time you go to the 
  Policies page and select the Custom category.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The user interface guidelines for Eclipse 
  recommend that you should use sentence style (initial letter only) capitalization 
  for display names.</p>
<p>To remove a policy from the Custom category, select it and click <span class="command">Delete</span>.</p>
