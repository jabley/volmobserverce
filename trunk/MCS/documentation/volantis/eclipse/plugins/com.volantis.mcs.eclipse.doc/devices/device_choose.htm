<h1>Choosing a device</h1>

<p>You can associate devices with layouts and themes by selecting one or more 
  devices from the device repository.</p>
<p>A tree view of the available devices is included as a page in the New Layout 
  and New Theme wizards. You can also view and select from the tree in the Layout 
  and Theme editors. When you add a device layout, you additionally specify either 
  a canvas or montage layout.</p>
<p>If you have already created a layout or theme and you open a device view, any 
  device names that you have already selected are filtered from the view.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the editor click the <span class="command">Browse</span> button under 
    the device list</li>
  <li>If you are choosing a device for a layout, select either Canvas or Montage 
    in <span class="uicontrol">Device Layout Type</span></li>
  <li>In the tree view, expand the tree, and check the checkbox next to the device 
    names to select them</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: To deselect all the files in a folder and 
  its sub folders, uncheck the box next to the folder name or click <span class="command">Deselect 
  all</span>.</p>
