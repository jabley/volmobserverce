      <p>Because new devices are always being added by manufacturers,
         and over 300 attributes are recorded for many devices, the
         MCS repository is continually reviewed and updated.</p>
      <p>You can obtain updates to a standard device repository from
         the update service over the Web, or update one or more
         projects from an recent download to your file system. You can
         also use the alternative <span class="code">mcsClientUpdate</span> command
         line utility to download the latest version from the update
         service.</p>
      <p>The update service requires a login; there is also an option
         to define the URL address and port of a proxy server,
         together with a username and password.</p>

         <h2>Repository versions</h2>
      
      <p>When you use the update service, you can choose the location
         of a repository to update, and you can optionally pick a
         specific revision of the standard repository. The revision
         identifier will usually consist of a date and version in the
         form yyyymmddvv. A description gives a brief overview of the
         changes.</p>
      
         <h2>Update methods</h2>
      
      <p>You can also specify whether the update should be merged with
         the existing repository, overwrite it, or saved to another
         file.</p>
      <dl>
         <dt>Merge</dt>
         <dd>Merge is the default setting. The update adds new device
            information to standard policies in the repository. Any
            changes you have made to identification patterns or policy
            values are not overwritten. No policies are removed, and
            existing devices retain their position in the hierarchy.
            If you select Merge, MCS creates a report listing the
            changes to the repository in the same directory as the
            existing repository. The report file is named in the form
               <span class="filepath">[existingfile
               revision]-[updatefile-revision].xml</span>. For
            more details see <em>Device repository update CLI</em>
            <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Merge does not affect any custom
               devices, custom policies or TACs that you have
            defined.</div>
         </dd>
         <dt>Overwrite</dt>
         <dd>The new repository replaces the current one entirely. Any
            changes you have made are overwritten.</dd>
         <dt>Save to file</dt>
         <dd>The new repository is saved to a different file location.
            The existing repository is unchanged.</dd>
