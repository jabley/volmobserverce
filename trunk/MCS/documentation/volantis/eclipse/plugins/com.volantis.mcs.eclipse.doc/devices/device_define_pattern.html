  </head>

  <body>
<h1>Defining identification patterns</h1>
<p>On the Overview page of the Device Repository editor you can define one or 
  more primary and secondary identification patterns for a device.</p>
<p>MCS uses the identification patterns at runtime to identify an unknown device. 
  The patterns are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. 
  They can be split into two sets; those that match user agent headers and those 
  that match general headers.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Patterns must be unique in a within a repository.</p>
<h2>Primary patterns</h2>
<p>MCS uses user agent headers in the first identification step.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a device from the Devices tree.</li>
  <li>In the Primary Patterns section click <span class="command">Add</span>. 
    A new item is added to the pattern list.</li>
  <li>Enter a regular expression that will be used to match the user agent header.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Secondary patterns</h2>
<p>The device that MCS finds using the primary patterns may indicate that there 
  is a more specific device to use, in which case MCS uses the secondary patterns 
  to match the general header. The patterns here are made up of three parts; an 
  HTTP header name, an HTTP header value and a Base device name.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In the Secondary Patterns section click <span class="command">Add</span>.</li>
  <li>Enter values for <span class="uicontrol">Header name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Value</span> 
    and <span class="uicontrol">Device name</span>.</li>
  <li>Use the <span class="command">Up</span> and <span class="command">Down</span> 
    buttons to order the patterns in the list</li>
</ol>
<p>To remove a pattern in eitherlist, select it and click <span class="command">Remove</span>.</p>
<p>To revert to the standard repository patterns for the device click <span class="command">Restore 
  Defaults</span>.</p>
