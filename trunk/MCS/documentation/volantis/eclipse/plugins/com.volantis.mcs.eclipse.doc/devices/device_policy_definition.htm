<h1>Custom policy definition</h1>
<p>Custom policies allow you to classify devices in a different way to the standard 
  Device policy tree. For example, you might issue a range of devices to employees 
  in your company. You could the set the type, style and presentation of information 
  available on your intranet to departments within your group, and also to different 
  cross-company teams.</p>
<p> Custom policies must be added to the Custom category below the Master device 
  level. They cannot be added elsewhere in the tree.</p>
<p>The New Policy wizard and the Policy Definition section on the Structure page 
  provide the controls to define a policy; the name, type, available values, and 
  associated meta-information that combine to make a device repository policy.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Policy names must be unique in a within 
  a repository.</p>
<h2>Policy composition and type</h2>
<p>Name, composition and type are defined in the first page of the wizard. You 
  use the <span class="uicontrol">Composition</span> drop-down to specify whether 
  the policy will contain a single value, an ordered set of values, or an unordered 
  set of values. The <span class="uicontrol">Type</span> control defines the type 
  of data that the policy contains.</p>
<p>The table shows the possible combinations and the controls that will be used 
  edit the values for the policy.</p>
