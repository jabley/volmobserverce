<h1>Device Repository view</h1>
<p>You can use the Device Repository view to examine the identifiers and policies 
  for the devices defined in the repository associated with your project, including 
  custom policies.</p>
<h2>Devices</h2>
<p>The Devices section of the browser contains a tree view of the devices available 
  in the repository. The structure of the tree reflects the fallback hierarchy 
  of the devices. You can expand the tree to make a single device selection.</p>
<h2>Identifiers</h2>
<p>MCS uses identification patterns at runtime to identify an unknown device. 
  The patterns are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. 
  These patterns are contained in an XML file. The Identifiers section of the 
  view displays the part of the XML file defining the patterns for the device 
  you have selected.</p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>In the Policies section you can view a list of device policies, or sets of 
  attributes for the device you have selected. You can click on a column heading 
  in the table to change the order of devices, and scroll the table to see the 
  attributes. The list has the following column headings:</p>
  
<ul>
  <li>Name</li>
  <li>Value</li>
  <li>Origin</li>
  <li>Category</li>
  <li>Short name</li>
  <li>Description</li>
</ul>
<p>Where the value of the policy is not inherited from an ancestor device the 
  origin will not have a value. This empty value will be deemed to be alphabetically 
  before any other value. This provides a convenient means of viewing all of the 
  policy values overridden on the selected device.<br>
