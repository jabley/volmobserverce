<h1>Updating a device repository</h1>
<p>Because new devices are always being added by manufacturers, and over 200 attributes 
  are recorded for many devices, the MCS repository is continually reviewed and 
  updated. You can obtain updates to the device repository over the Web, or update 
  one or more projects from an recent download to your file system.</p>
<p>Using the Import wizard you can:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Define the location of the repository to be updated</li>
  <li>Choose the location to import from. You can choose an HTTP download from 
    the MCS update service (default) or a location on the file system</li>
  <li>Optionally choose a repository revision</li>
  <li>Specify the location to save the update, and specify whether the update 
    should be merged with the existing repository, overwrite it, or saved to another 
    file </li>
</ul>

<ol>
  <li>Choose <span class="command">File</span>  |  <span class="command">Import</span></li>
  <li>Select Import MCS Device Repository in the workbench Import wizard and click 
    <span class="command">Next</span></li>
  <li>Accept the <span class="uicontrol">Current device repository, </span> or 
    use the <span class="command">Browse</span> button to select another repository 
    to update</li>
  <li>Accept the <span class="uicontrol">MCS device repository update service</span> 
    default. Otherwise uncheck the option to locate a repository on the file system, 
    and go to step 8.</li>
  <li>Accept the default <span class="uicontrol">Import latest revision</span> 
    option or uncheck it</li>
  <li>Enter your update service Username and Password. To add details of a proxy 
    server go to step 7. Otherwise go to step 9.</li>
  <li>Check <span class="uicontrol"></span><span class="uicontrol">Use proxy for 
    connection</span> and enter the information. Go to step 9.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Browse</span> in the <span class="uicontrol">File</span> 
    control to locate a repository on the file system. Go to step 14.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next.</span> If you accepted <span class="uicontrol">Import 
    latest revision</span>, go to step 12</li>
  <li>Select a revision from the list</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
  <li>Accept the <span class="uicontrol">Merge</span> option, or choose <span class="uicontrol">Overwrite</span> 
    and go to step 14. Alternatively, choose the <span class="uicontrol">Save 
    to file</span> option.</li>
  <li>On the next page, enter a folder location or <span class="command">Browse</span> 
    to it and name the file</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to download or copy the repository. 
    MCS reports any communication problems.</li>
</ol>
<p>During download MCS displays a progress bar. If the download is successful 
  you'll see a confirmation message. </p>
