<h1>About devices<img src="../images/device_layout_banner.gif" align="left" alt="Device layout icon"></h1>
<p>MCS comes with a built-in repository that can contain a large number of devices 
  from desktop PCs to TVs, PDAs and mobile phones. The range of devices in your 
  repository will depend on the specific repository that you have installed.</p>
<p>A device repository consists of a compressed XML file containing attributes 
  of the devices. You can have multiple device repositories on your system, and 
  you can choose one to suit the requirements of your project. The repository 
  files have a .mdpr extension.</p>
<p>When you create a new web project, you need to associate the project with a 
  single device repository, so you can create device layouts and device themes 
  for the project. This repository can be anywhere on your system.</p>
<p>You can view the attributes for devices in the repository using a workbench 
  Device Repository view. You can also make changes to policy values and identification 
  patterns using the Device Repository editor.</p>
<h2>Device repository update service</h2>
<p>Because new devices are always being added by manufacturers, and over 200 attributes 
  are recorded for many devices, the MCS repository is continually reviewed and 
  updated. You can obtain updates to the device repository over the Web.</p>
<h2>Fallback</h2>
<p>Each set of device policies has a parent set. If a policy does not exist for 
  the child entry, the parent entry is searched and the the fallback value is 
  used. Fallback is recursive, so that policies may be inherited across a number 
  of 'generations'.</p>
<h2>Custom device policies</h2>
<p> In addition to the device policies that are built in to MCS, you can add custom 
  policies in a special Custom category. You may have your own requirements for 
  the way certain devices or groups of devices are handled. </p>
<p>These changes, together with any changes you have made to policy values or 
  identification patterns, are kept in a custom section of the repository.</p>
