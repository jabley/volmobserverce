<h1>Identification patterns</h1>
<p>In the Device Repository editor you can edit one or more primary and secondary 
  identification patterns for a device.</p>
<p>MCS uses the identification patterns at runtime to identify an unknown device. 
  The patterns are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. 
  They can be split into two sets; those that match user agent headers and those 
  that match general headers.</p>

<p>The device that MCS finds using the primary patterns may indicate that there 
  is a more specific device to use, in which case MCS uses the secondary patterns 
  to match the general header.</p>

<p>The secondary patterns here are made up of three parts; an HTTP header name, 
  an HTTP header value and a device name matching a primary pattern device name, 
  shown in three columns in the editor.</p>
