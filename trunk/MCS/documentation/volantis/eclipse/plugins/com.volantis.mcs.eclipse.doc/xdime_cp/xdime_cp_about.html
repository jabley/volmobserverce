<h1>XDIME 2 and XDIME-CP</h1>
<p>XDIME 2 and XDIME Content Provider Profile (XDIME-CP) together provide developers 
  with a simple, standards-compliant authoring environment. </p>
<p>XDIME-CP is a subset of XDIME 2, giving content providers a way to develop 
  content in cooperation with their carrier partners, without requiring knowledge 
  of the complexities of multi-channel adaptation services.</p>
<p>Elements in XDIME 2 provide bindings to layouts and themes. So carriers can 
  develop and manage the adaptation process, applying consistent branding to the 
  sites they provide. For example the carrier may provide a general style guide 
  to their content partners, and focus their development efforts around the layout 
  and theme policies used on the site.</p>
<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: XDIME can also act as an XDIME-CP container, 
  using a different element structure.</div>
<p>XDIME 2 and XDIME-CP differ in some details from existing XDIME syntax for 
  the equivalent elements. So even if you already understand XDIME well, you will 
  need to note these points of difference.</p>
<p>The new vocabulary is easy to learn and use. It relies on key web authoring 
  specifications, and the way in which these standards are combined and used is 
  based on work currently under way in the W3C Device Independence Working group.</p>
<ul>
  <li>XHTML Version 2</li>
  <li>CSS Version 2.1 enhanced with some features of the forthcoming CSS Version 
    3</li>
  <li>XForms Version 1.0</li>
  <li>DISelect Version 1.0</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are not familiar with these recommendations, you may want to review 
  them before you develop any XDIME-CP content, and refer to the <em>XDIME 2 elements</em> 
  together with any guidelines provided by your carrier partners.</p>
