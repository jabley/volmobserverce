<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>Provides a simple API to a framework for migrating a resource from multiple
old versions to the current version of a product.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>This migration framework is designed to automagically migrate an individual
resource at at time.</p>

<p>It is based around the concept of the client code defining small steps to
migrate a resource from one version to the next version and the framework
composing those steps as necessary to migrate from the version of the resource
found to the current version, possibly using many steps in sequence to achieve
the result. For example, say the client code defines a two migration steps,
once which can migrate from v1 to v2, and one from v2 to v3. This means that
the framework can compose those steps to handle migrating from both v1 and v2
through to v3. v1 is handled by running the first step and then the second,
whereas v2 only requires running the second step.</p>

<p>Each resource to be migrated is assumed to have a type and version. The type
is a named entity which represents the logical content type of the file. For
example an MCS .mthm file uses the marlin-lpdm schema. In this case, we would
consider that all MCS .mlyt, .mimg, etc files would be of type "lpdm". The
version is a named entity which represents the version of the product that the
type was created for. For example, a .mthm file containing a schema location of
http://www.volantis.com/schema/v3.0/marlin-lpdm.xsd would be of version "3.0".
</p>

<p>The migration framework (in particular, {@link ResourceMigrationBuilder}),
requires client code to define all the versions of the product and the various
resource types. Each type must be configured to identify the versions of
content it wishes to migrate, and the various migration steps required to move
a resource from an old version to the current version. The framework will
handle composing those steps together into a "graph" as necessary when a
migration is performed.<p>

<p>The migration framework comes with standard implementations to recognise
resource types and content based on regular expressions, and a standard
implementation to migrate an XML resource from one version to another based on
XSLT. If the client code wants to use alternative mechanisms, they may provide
custom implementation code to recognise types and content or migrate individual
versions.<p>

<h2>Core Classes</h2>

<p>The core interfaces for this package are as follows:</p>

<dl>
    <dt>{@link ResourceMigratorBuilder}</dt>
    <dd>Instances of this interface allows client code to configure the
    different types and versions of resource that the migration should handle,
    along with various ways to identify those resource types and versions, and
    various ways to migrate resources between individual versions. Once the way
    the migration should work has been defined, it can create an instance of
    {@link ResourceMigrator} which perform migration using that definition.
    </dd>

    <dt>{@link ResourceMigrator}</dt>
    <dd>This interface is the core of the migration framework. Instances
    of this interface allow a client of the framework to migrate a resource
    from an old version to the current version in a single easy step. It relies
    on {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} to define it's behaviour.
    </dd>

    <dt>{@link OutputCreator}</dt>
    <dd>This callback interface must be implemented by client code and passed
    into {@link ResourceMigrator#migrate} to allow the migrator to create
    an output stream for the resource under migration at the point that it is
    needed.</dd>

    <dt>{@link FrameworkFactory}</dt>
    <dd>This abstract factory is the entry point into the package and allows
    creation of {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} instances and {@link Version}
    instances required for use with the builder.</dd>

    <dt>{@link Version}</dt>
    <dd>Instances of this interface can be created by {@link FrameworkFactory}
    to define the product versions that the {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder}
    works with.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Customisation Classes</h2>

<p>The framework allows client code to provide custom implementations of the
various framework actions to {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} to allow custom
identification and migration capabilities. These are as follows:</p>

<dl>

    <dt>{@link PathRecogniser}</dt>
    <dd>This interface can be implemented by client code and passed into
    {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} in order to identify a particular resource
    type, if the standard ways are not capable enough.</dd>

    <dt>{@link ContentRecogniser}</dt>
    <dd>This interface can be implemented by client code and passed into
    {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} in order to identify a particular resource
    version, if the standard ways are not capable enough.</dd>

    <dt>{@link StreamMigrator}</dt>
    <dd>This interface can be implemented by client code and passed into
    {@link ResourceMigratorBuilder} in order to migrate a resource version to
    another version, if the standard ways are not capable enough.</dd>

</dl>
