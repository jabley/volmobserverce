# Translator Instructions:
#
# The messages to be translated are contained in key/text pairs and
# contain three parts:
#
# 1) A key (a text string) which is an identifier used by the code to
# retrieve data. This is required - and SHOULD NOT be translated.
# 2) An equals ("=") sign separating the key and text. This is required.
# 3) A string containing data that will be displayed to the user when
# running the application. This is required and SHOULD be translated.
#
# In short, each line in the resource array contains two strings.
# The SECOND string on each line should be translated.
#
# Some of the strings to be translated contain special codes within {}
# for data that will be inserted into the string when the string
# is displayed to the user. You should NOT translate any text that
# appears within {}
# (e.g. do not translate the word elements in the example below):
#
# ODOMLabelProvider.theme.summary = {deviceName}, {externalStyleSheetURL}
#
# Lines that begin with a pound sign (#) are comments and should NOT be
# translated.
#
# Where multiple occurrences of {} exist in a line, the order should NOT be
# changed.
#
# There are also blocks of text surrounded with the following text strings
# DO NOT LOCALIZE:
# The text inside these blocks should NOT be translated.
#
# If the property contains a variable (denoted by {0} or {1}) then any
# apostrophe must be escaped by a second apostrophe (i.e. use '').
# If there is not a variable in the property then apostrophes should
# not be escaped.
#
# A comment of type NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT* where * is _ALL, _NONE or _VAR should be
# included (required by IBM's chkpii tool). _VAR should be used while single
# apostrophes are handled as described above.
#
# NLS_MESSAGEFORMAT_VAR
