Provides classes and interfaces for managing and using the web driver.

<h2>Using Web Driver</h2>

<p>The web driver can make use of and generate additional out of band data, i.e.
information that is not passed through the pipeline. This section explains how
to do this.</p>

<p>The out of band input to the web driver consists of the following HTTP
information which is supplied to the web driver in a
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverRequest} object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>Request parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>The out of band output from the web driver consists of the following HTTP
information which is returned by the web driver in a
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverResponse} object.</p>
<ul>
<li>Cookies</li>
<li>Headers</li>
<li>Status code</li>
<li>Content type</li>
<li>Ignored content</li>
</ul>

<p>The web driver retrieves both the above objects from the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverFactory} that it is
configured with. The web driver will work if it cannot access any
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverRequest} or
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverResponse} objects
either because their is no factory, or a factory method returns null.
</p>
<p>If a {@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverRequest} could
not be retrieved then the web driver simply behaves as if it was given one which
was empty. If a
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverResponse} could not be
retrieved then the web driver does not return any information from the server.
In an analagous way if the objects do exist but some of the referenced
objects do not then they are treated as if they are empty.</p>
<p>{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverRequest} and
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.   web.WebDriverResponse} objects
can be created using methods in the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverFactory} class.</p>
<p>There can be multiple web driver usages within the lifetime of a single
pipeline and in order to distinguish between them they each have an id. This is
used by the web driver when it is retrieving the response objects from
the factory.</p>
<p>The request and response objects can either be created before the pipeline
starts and stored in the pipeline context, or be created on demand. The exact
behaviour is determined by the implementor of the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.drivers.web.WebDriverFactory}.</p>
