<head><title>Dissection</title></head>
<body>
This class takes a dom tree and then splits it up into chunks which can
be sent to devices with limited page sizes.
<p>
Before a DissectingPane writes its contents to the page it checks to see
whether the content will be dissected. If it is then it wraps the output
within special dissection specific tags. When one of these special start tags
is found then a special DissectableNode is added to the parse tree and is
the root of the parse tree created from parsing the contents of the
DissectingPane.
<p>
The dissectable document tree looks something like this.
<pre>
                                _+_
                             _-~   ~-_
                          _-~         ~-_
                       _-~               ~-_
                    _-~              @      ~-_
                 _-~     @          / \        ~-_
              _-~       / \        /   \          ~-_
           _-~         /   \      /     \            ~-_
</pre>
Where + is the root of the whole tree and @ are the roots of the dissectable
areas. The area inside the tree but outside the two sub trees is the
fixed content and is the same regardless of what portion of the dissectable
area is used.
<p>
The size of the fixed content is calculated by recursing down the tree
summing up the sizes of all the nodes. The recursion ignores dissectable area
nodes and their descendants. This value is then subtracted from the maximum page
size limit leaving the space available for the dissectable areas.
<p>
This space has to be shared out amongst each of the dissectable areas
according to some scheme which has yet to be decided, probably by
associating some weight with each DissectingPane, currently each area
has an equal share.
<p>
The dissectable areas are dissected independently of each other, although
the amount of space needed for navigation depends on the number of areas.
<p>
Each dissectable area is split into multiple shards and each shard consists
of multiple nodes. The following shows an example of the possible contents of
the dissectable area.
<pre>
                                 A
                                _+_
                             _-~/ \~-_
                          _-~  /   \  ~-_
                       _-~    /     \    ~-_
                    _-~      /       \      ~-_
                 _-~        /         \        ~-_
              _-~          /           \          ~-_
           _-~            /             \            ~-_

</li>
</ul>
Each node can be in either one shard or a consecutive range of shards as is
shown below. A node cannot be in shards 1 and 3 without also being in 2.
Which means that each node simply has to store the first and last shards
which it belong to and not list each particular shard. The following list
shows this:
<ul>
<li>Node A is in shards 0, 1, 2, 3.</li>
<li>Node B is in shards 0, 1.</li>
<li>Nodes C and D are in shard 0.</li>
<li>Nodes E,F,G,H and I are in shard 1.</li>
<li>Node J is in shards 2, 3.</li>
<li>Nodes K and L are in shard 2.</li>
<li>Nodes M,N,O,P and Q are in shard 3.</li>
</ul>
This table lists those nodes which only belong in 1 shard and the number of
the shard that they belong to. It shows how each shard consists of a
sequence of leaf nodes in node order.
<center><table border="1">
<tr>
<th align="left">Node</th>
<td>C</td><td>D</td><td>E</td><td>F</td><td>G</td><td>H</td><td>I</td>
<td>K</td><td>L</td><td>M</td><td>N</td><td>O</td><td>P</td><td>Q</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th align="left">Shard</th>
<td>0</td><td>0</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td><td>1</td>
<td>2</td><td>2</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td><td>3</td>
</tr>
</table></center>
<h3>Dissecting into shards</h3>
This is done as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Each node is visited in document order (that is alphabetical order in the
above tree) and added to the shard if there is enough room.
</li>
<li>
If a node is complete (which means that it and all its children already
belong to a shard) then it is ignored.
</li>
<li>
If the node will fit then it (and implicitly all its children) is added to
the shard, marked as complete and the available space is reduced by the size
of that nodes contents.
</li>
<li>
If a node will not fit in the shard and it has children then the amount of
space available is reduced by the node's overhead (which is typically the
size of the open and close tags in the case of an element, or the size of the
shard navigation links in the case of a dissectable area) and each child is
visited.
</li>
<li>
If the node will not fit and doesn't have any children then the shard is
finished and this node will be the first node in the next shard.
</li>
<li>
When the last child of a node is added to a shard then that node is marked
as completed and won't be visited again.
</li>
<li>
If no element is added to a shard then a ProtocolException is thrown.
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Generating dissected contents</h3>
The contents of a dissected page are generated by recursing down through
the tree adding the open and close tags and the content to a buffer. When
the root of a dissectable tree is reached, it asks its children to generate
their content only if they belong to the requested shard.
