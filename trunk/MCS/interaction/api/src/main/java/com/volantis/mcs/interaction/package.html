Provides a layer that can be applied on top of an object model to allow the
model to be interacted with, e.g. from a GUI.

<h2>Interaction Layer</h2>

<p>The interaction layer provides most of the capabilities normally required of
a model by interactive applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generalised access to the properties and contents of the model.</li>
<li>Notification of changes to the model.</li>
<li>Diagnostic management (it is assumed that the model will perform its own
validation).</li>
<li>Dynamic construction of model.</li>
<li>Undo/redo support.</li>
</ul>

<p>The reason for separating these capabilities from the underlying object model
is that it greatly simplifies the object model which typically will be used
from a number of different places, not just from within interactive
applications. It also allows them to be used across many diverse object
models.</p>

<p>Although this is not restricted to being used by a user interface this will
by its typical use so that term will be used when referring to the code that
uses this layer.</p>

<h3>Relationship with Underlying Model</h3>

<p>The underlying model consists of a number of connected model objects. These
objects can contain a number of properties, some of which will be simple types,
some of which will be lists (other collections and maps are not supported at the
moment) and some of which will be references to other objects in the model. The
interaction layer is only interested in those externally visible aspects of an
object that have to be exposed to the user interface, e.g. fields or methods
that are not used by the user interface can be ignored.</p>

<p>The interaction layer contains a proxy for each model object and
also one for each of the simple and list properties. For each property a
reference exists from the proxy representing the model object
containing the property to the proxy representing the property. This
means that proxies in the interaction layer shadow model items.</p>

<p>The classes for the proxies do not form a parallel hierarchy to the
classes in the model as that would reduce the benefits of separating the
interaction aspects out from the model. Instead the proxies are
heavily parameterised to allow them to manage any model object.</p>

<p>The only requirement that the interaction layer places on the model is that
when it performs validation it provides enough information to uniquely identify
the proxy representing the value that has the problem. For model
objects this is just the object itself but if the problem is with a property of
a model object then it is the name of the property as well as the object
containing that property.</p>

<p>The proxies are always arranged in a tree structure even if the
underlying model represents a graph.</p>

<h3>Events</h3>

<p>Changes to the model are only made through the interaction layer so it will
always know when a change occurs and can report them to any interested
parties. Changes generate event on a proxy and the events bubble up the
interaction hierarchy until they reach the top. Listeners can be registered on
a proxy to received either events only from that proxy, or events from that
proxy and all its descendants.</p>

<h3>Diagnostics</h3>

<p>A diagnostic message is an indication that there is something not quite
right with the underlying model. The model must implement validation, this is
because other usages of the model will also need to be able to validate. The
model validation mechanism needs the following capabilities:
<ul>
<li>It should not fail at the first problem (e.g. by throwing an exception),
instead it should keep going to try and find as many problems in one go.</li>
<li>It must report the location of the error, including the property. This is to
allow the errors to be associated with the correct interaction proxy.</li>
<li>Diagnostics must contain both an internationalized message as well as a
language independent key and arguments. This is to allow the user interface
to provide special support for particular errors.</li>
<li>It should generate the most important messages first as the user interface
may only be able to display a small number of messages. The messages will be
sorted by severity first, followed by their original order.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although the interaction layer does not mandate a specific implementation
of validation it should have built in support for the validation infrastructure
defined in the validation subsystem. It is recommended that models use that as
their validation framework.</p>

<p>Validation occurs across the whole model any time that the model changes as
a local change could break another part of the model. It is the responsibility
of the user interface to register a listener to detect those changes and
invoke the validation. The interaction layer will then collate all the
diagnostic messages at the top level and also target them at the appropriate
proxy. This allows all the diagnostics to be displayed globally as
well as providing filtered diagnostics on a per proxy basis.</p>

<h3>Dynamic Construction</h3>

<p>There are two ways in which the interaction layer is constructed. It can
either be constructed from an existing model (or part of a model), or
constructed by the user interface directly. In the latter case the proxies are
responsible for creating the underlying model objects but otherwise
they are not.</p>

<p>When a model has first been loaded it is associated with the interaction
layer which then grows the proxies over the top of it. In order for it to do
this the layer needs information to describe each class of object that can be
stored in the model. This means that it needs to be able to map from the class
of the object to that information. This is complicated by the fact that the
actual class of an object may not be the same as its publicly visible class.</p>

<p>In some cases a partial model may also be constructed directly by the user
interface, e.g. by using a parser that can convert from a text input directly
by the user into the model, or by selecting from a list of predefined model
objects. When this partial model is associated with a proxy this
will cause the previously associated proxy to be discarded (actually
saved away in case it should be undone) and new proxies grown over
the partial model.</p>

<p>When the user performs some action on the user interface to create a new
object in the model first an appropriate proxy is created. That proxy
will create the underlying model object if and when it is necessary, e.g. when
the user has set some values on the model.</p>

<h3>Operations</h3>

<p>An operation is something that can be performed on the model that will cause
a change to the model and hence trigger events. Currently all operations must be
undoable and redoable.</p>

<p>There are only be a very small number of operations that can be performed
on the model:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Name</th>
<th>Description</th>
<th>Undo / Redo State</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Set Property</td>
<td>Sets a property to a new value.</td>
<td>Old and new values.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Add To List</td>
<td>Adds an object to the end of a list.</td>
<td>New object.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Insert In List</td>
<td>Inserts an object at a specific position in a list.</td>
<td>Position in the list and the object to insert.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Remove From List</td>
<td>Removes an object from the list.</td>
<td>The object that was removed and its position within the list.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>It is possible to compose multiple operations on an proxy into a
single composite operation that can be atomically applied, e.g. moving a proxy
from one position in a list to another can be represented as a remove followed
by an insert. When composing operations it may also be necessary to compose
the events that will be triggered by those operations. Otherwise a listener
would see a sequence of events and responding to them individually could cause
unnecessary work, e.g. repainting the control.</p>
