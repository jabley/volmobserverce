Provides support for parts of the style sheet to manage state that is specific
to a styling engine instance.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Many components of the style sheet do not require any state specific to
the styling engine that is using the style sheet, however some parts do. Rather
than provide separate support for each different piece of state that is needed
a generic mechanism is provided that can support all the usages.</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>

<p>A style sheet component that requires styling engine specific state
must first register a {@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.StateInstanceFactory} with
the {@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.MutableStateRegistry} when the style
sheet is built. It must then store the returned
{@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.StateIdentifier} as it
will need to use it later to retrieve the
{@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.State} object.</p>

<p>When the component is used within the styling engine it uses the identifier
that it stored previously to retrieve the
{@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.State} object from the
{@link com.volantis.styling.impl.state.StateContainer}. If the container has
not already created the appropriate state object it uses the identifier to
retrieve the factory from the registry and uses the factory to create the
state.</p>
