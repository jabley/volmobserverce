Provides facilities to interpret CSS counter for a document.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>This package implements the interpretation of the CSS counter-reset and
counter-increment properties to allow the resultant values to be be used
for automagically iterating pane references in XDIMECP.</p>

<p>Please refer to the *latest* CSS 2.1 spec to understand how CSS counters
work, as they are not entirely obvious and the spec is still changing in this
area at the time this was written.</p>

<h2>Design Overview</h2>

<p>Once the styling has been done on an element, we have the effective style
properties for that element available. If these properties include any
counter-* properties, these must be interpreted to allow us to calculate the
current counter values. The interpretation also needs to know when the elements
in the document being processed start and finish so that it may deal with
nested counters appropriately.</p>

<p>The interpretation is implemented via CounterEngine which will manage a set
of named Counter objects, each of which is reponsible for dealing with nesting
issues to provide the current effective value of the namedcounter. CounterEngine
will have startElement(Styles), endElement() and Integer getCounter(String name)
methods. The startElement method will interpret the counter-* values in the
styles supplied in order to create newly referenced counters and reset or
increment the counters as appropriate. The endElement method will delete
counters as they go out of scope. The startElement and endElement methods will
also delegate to each in-scope counter to allow them to support counter nesting
by maintaining an internal value stack which will grow and shrink as we move up
and input DOM.</p>
