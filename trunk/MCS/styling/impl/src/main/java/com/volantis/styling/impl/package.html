Provides facilities to apply styles to a document.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>The purpose of this package and its descendant packages is to provide the
capability to apply CSS like styles to an input document. Initially this is
needed as part of MCS's theme support but it is likely that it will be needed
in other products, specifically the transcoder to support styling properly.</p>

<h2>Design Overview</h2>

<p>The design is split into two main parts, the style sheet and the styling
engine. The style sheet contains all the information necessary to apply the
style and the engine actually applies the style. As the engine contains all the
state necessary to apply the style sheet to a document it means that the style
sheet can be used by multiple engines simultaneously.</p>

<p>Styling is a very intensive process and will be done for every element in
the input document so must be designed to be efficient. As a style sheet will
be applied many more times than it is built the internal structure of the style
sheet must be geared towards making styling efficient, as opposed to making
building, or even storage efficient. This means that where a trade off needs to
be made it should be resolved in favour of styling performance.</p>

<p>The style sheet is an opaque representation of a style sheet. It does not
expose any methods to query its contents. It's sole purpose is to be used by
a styling engine. A styling engine is constructed for a specific style sheet,
once it has been finished with it is simply thrown away, along with all its
internal state.</p>

<p>Neither the style sheet, nor the styling engine know anything about
any style property's characteristics, i.e. their initial values, whether they
are inherited, etc. They have to be provided with this information through
the {@link com.volantis.styling.properties.StyleProperty StyleProperty}.</p>

<h2>Style Sheet Construction</h2>

<p>A {@link com.volantis.styling.sheet.CompiledStyleSheet CompiledStyleSheet} is
constructed from a {@link  com.volantis.mcs.themes.StyleSheet StyleSheet} by a
{@link com.volantis.styling.compiler.StyleSheetCompiler StyleSheetCompiler}.
See {@link com.volantis.styling.compiler} for details as to how the StyleSheet
is compiled.</p>

<h2>Styling Process</h2>

<p>Internally the style sheet consists of an ordered list of styler objects
that are created from CSS like rules. Their order is based on the specificity
of the rule so that when they are applied in order the result is equivalent to
the CSS cascade. These stylers are responsible for determining whether they
match the current element and if they do then they merge the associated styles
with the element's existing styles.</p>

<p>The styling engine simply iterates through the stylers in order, invoking
them for the element that is being styled and returning the resulting
styles.</p>

<h2>Deferred Styling</h2>

<p>CSS assumes in its specification of the styling process that the document to
which it is applying has already been built. However, this is not the case with
the styling engine, it has to apply the styles as early as possible while the
document is being built. This is because there are style properties that can
cause the element and its contents to be ignored and the earlier that these are
detected the better the performance will be.</p>

<p>There is also an MCS specific reason for doing this. In XDIME the
<code>pane</code> attribute targets the content of the element at a specific
pane. If that pane does not exist in the current layout then that element and
all its content is ignored. In XDIME-CP this pane targeting will be done using
MCS extension properties and it is important that backwards compatability is
maintained as much as possible.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there are matchers that cannot determine whether they match
until they have seen information that appears in the document after the element
to which the styles are supposed to apply. In this case the engine would have
no choice but to defer the styling until that information has been seen.
Fortunately at the moment there is no need to support these additional
matchers, however they will be needed in the very near future so the design
must be flexible enough to accommodate it without a major redesign, hence the
reason why the approach is outlined here.</p>

<p>The responsibility for determining whether matching is possible, or whether
it has to be deferred is up to the stylers so they will need to indicate,
possibly with a return value whether styling has to be deferred or not. As soon
as a styler determines that styling has to be deferred the styling engine must
stop and record the information necessary to resume the styling when more
information is available.</p>
