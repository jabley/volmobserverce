Provides support for tracking dependencies within the pipeline in order to
enable caches to determine when an entry (or one of its dependencies has
changed).

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>One of the major uses of the pipeline is to dynamically create pages
from a combination of various sources of information, e.g. external resources,
device policies, request parameters, etc. However, generating dynamic pages can
take quite a long time and it is often beneficial to performance for pages, or
parts of pages to be cached for as long as possible. The difficult part of that
is determining when it is no longer valid to use a cached entry and
regenerating it. This is where this package comes in.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This package provides the infrastructure necessary to track and check
dependencies within the pipeline to address the issue raised above.

<h3>Terminology</h3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>source</strong></dt>
<dd>An owner of information that is used to construct a page and which can
change over the course of its lifetime. e.g. a request parameter, device
policy value, external resource, XSLT, SQL database, ...</dd>
<dt><strong>original source</strong></dt>
<dd>The source from which a page or page fragment was constructed and against
which a dependency must be revalidated if it is no longer fresh.</dd>
<dt><strong>dependency</strong></dt>
<dd>A representation of the dependency that a page or page fragment has on an
original source. e.g. if the original source is a device policy then this would
contain the name of the policy and its value at the time the dependency was
established.</dd>
<dt><strong>valid, validity</strong></dt>
<dd>A valid dependency is one that still matches the original source, an
invalid dependency is one that does not match the original source.</dd>
<dt><strong>revalidate, revalidation</strong></dt>
<dd>The process of checking the validity of a dependency that may not be
valid. If the dependency is not valid then this typically also updates the
dependency with information from the original source.</dd>
