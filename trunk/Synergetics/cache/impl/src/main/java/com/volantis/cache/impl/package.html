Implementation of a general caching infrastructure.

<h2>Cache Infrastructure</h2>

<h3>Synchronization</h3>

<p>One of the most awkward parts of implementing a cache is ensuring that
synchronizing of the different objects involved is done correctly, i.e.</p>

<ul>
<li>State that may be accessed from multiple threads is protected against
corruption by synchronizing consistently on the same monitor.</li>
<li>Nesting of synchronization blocks are avoided where possible.</li>
<li>Where nesting is unavoidable they are always nested in the same order to
avoid deadlocks.</li>
</ul>

<p>The following details the mutexes used within the cache and how they are
nested.</p>

<dl>
<dt>CacheEntryImpl</dt>
<dd>This is the primary mutex as it controls access to an entry which is the
main synchronization object. This mutex must not be nested within ANY other
mutex. While this is held the code obtains the following mutexes.
<ul>
<li>CacheImpl#map</li>
<li>GroupImpl#entries</li>
<li>GroupImpl#groupsMutex</li>
<li>StatisticsGatherer</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>CacheImpl#map</dt>
<dd>Protects the map from key to CacheEntry. While this is held the code
must not obtain any other mutexes.</dd>

<dt>GroupImpl#entries</dt>
<dd>Protects the entry list and the total count. While this is held the code
must not obtain any other mutexes.</dd>

<dt>GroupImpl#groupsMutex</dt>
<dd>Protects the group map, this is needed because the group map is lazily
created but the mutex protecting it cannot be. While this is held the code
must not obtain any other mutexes.</dd>

<dt>StatisticsGatherer</dt>
<dd>Protects the statistics. While this is held the code must not obtain any
other mutexes.</dd>

</dl>
