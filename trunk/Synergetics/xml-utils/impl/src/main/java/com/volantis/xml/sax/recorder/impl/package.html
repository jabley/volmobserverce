<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>The main incentive for creating this whole mechanism is to improve
performance and so that has to be considered at all stages in the design. The
following guidelines were followed.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Avoid creating any unnecessary objects, reuse where appropriate
        but don't pool objects as that degrades garbage collection
        performance.</li>

    <li>Recording is performed once, playing back is performed lots of times so
        it is appropriate to improve the performance of playing at the expense
        of recording performance.</li>

    <li>Don't break good OO practices unless they have been proven to have a
        significant impact on performance and in that case clearly document the
        code.</li> 
</ul>
