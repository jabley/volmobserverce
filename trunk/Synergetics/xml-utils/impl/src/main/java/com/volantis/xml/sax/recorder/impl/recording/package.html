Provides classes that represent a recording.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>A recording is created within the {@link SAXRecorderImpl} and when it has
finished it creates an instance of {@link SAXRecordingImpl} that can then be
played.</p>

<h3>Efficient implementation of {@link SAXRecording}.</h3>

<p>In this case efficiency means that it stores the events in a fixed number
of arrays, rather than in lots of little objects. The reason for this is
because it is much easier to GC a few large objects than lots of little
objects.</p>

<p>See {@link SAXRecorderImpl} for details as to how the events are
recorded.</p>
