Provides classes and interfaces for efficiently storing the attributes for a
number of SAX <code>startElement</code> events.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>A SAX attribute consists of 5 separate strings. Rather than create a single
object for each attribute that has 5 fields the SAX API provides a container
{@link Attributes} that provides access to the individual fields of each
attribute but no abstraction of a single attribute. This makes it possible for
the container to store all the information for a single startElement event's
attributes in a single array.</p>

<p>The classes in this package extend that concept to allow all the attributes
for a number of <code>startElement</code> events to be stored in a single
array within a container. Of course the fact that it is stored in a single
array is not exposed to the user of the classes.</p>

<p>The {@link AttributesContainer} interface defines the behaviour of the
container and the {@link AttributesWindow} provides a view on a range of
attributes within the container.</p>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<p>A {@link AttributesContainerBuilder} is created and populated while
building up the recording. When recording has finished it is used to construct
a {@link AttributesContainer} that is then owned by the recording. All the
strings for the attributes are mapped to an index using the {@link StringTable}
so that they are shared.</p>

<p>Every time the recording is played back by a {@link SAXPlayer} it creates a
new {@link AttributesWindow} and exposes the appropriate range of attributes
for each <code>startElement</code> event sent to the SAX event handler.</p>

<pre>
    private AttributesWindow window = container.createWindow();

    public void play()
        throws SAXException {

          :
        // Process the startElement event.
          :
        // Extract the range of attributes from the event.
        int offset = ...;
        int length = ...;

        window.move(offset, length);

        // Forward the startElement event to the SAX event handler.
        handler.startElement(namespaceURI, localName, qName, window);
          :
    }
</pre>
