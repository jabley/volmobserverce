Provides classes and interfaces for recording and playing back SAX events.

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to record a stream of SAX events so that they can
be played back at a later time. e.g. in order to prevent a file, or block of
XML from being repeatedly parsed. The classes defined within this package
provide that capability.</p>

<h3>Getting Started</h3>

<p>The first thing that needs to be done is to retrieve the factory that is
responsible for creating the various objects used within this package.

<pre>
    SAXRecorderFactory factory = SAXRecorderFactory.getDefaultInstance();
</pre>

<h3>Recording</h3>

<p>Recording is performed by creating a suitable configured
{@link SAXRecorder}, connecting that up to a SAX event source, e.g. a parser,
and generating the stream of events. The {@link SAXRecording} can be retrieved
after all the events have been generated assuming that no fatal errors
occurred.</p>

<pre>
    // Create the configuration, once this has been initialised it can be used
    // for creating a number of SAXRecorder instances.
    SAXRecorderConfiguration configuration
        = factory.createSAXRecorderConfiguration();

    // .. initialise the configuration ...

    // Create the recorder with the specified configuration.
    SAXRecorder recorder = factory.createSAXRecorder(configuration);

    // Connect the recorder to the SAX event source.
    XMLReader reader = XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader()
    reader.setContentHandler(recorder.getContentHandler());
    reader.setErrorHandler(... error handler that throws fatal errors ...);

    // Generate the events.
    reader.parse("event-source.xml");

    // Get the recording.
    SAXRecording recording = recorder.getRecording();
</pre>

<h3>Playing</h3>

<p>Playing back is performed by creating a {@link SAXPlayer} appropriate to the
recording, connecting it to a SAX event sink and playing.</p>

<pre>
    // Get an event sink.
    OutputFormat format = new OutputFormat();
    format.setOmitXMLDeclaration(true);
    format.setLineSeparator("\n");
    format.setEncoding("utf-8");
    XMLSerializer serializer = new XMLSerializer(format);
    serializer.setOutputByteStream(System.out);

    // Create the player.
    SAXPlayer player = recording.createPlayer();

    // Attach the player to an event sink.
    player.setContentHandler(serializer.asContentHandler());

    // Play the recording.
    player.play();
</pre>

<h3>Flow Control</h3>

<p>As the whole document has been processed before any events are generated it
is very easy and efficient to support flow control, e.g. to exit a specified
number of nesting levels.</p>

<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<p>There are a number of enhancements that could be made to this recorder.</p>

<h4>Support All SAX 2 Events</h4>

<p>There are many other SAX 2 events, in the extension interfaces that could be
recorded by this.</p>

<h4>Character Array Buffering</h4>

<p>There is a slight issue that the internal character buffer is exposed to
the SAX event handler through the characters and ignorableWhitespace events.
Modifications to that array by the handler would change the state of the
recording and hence affect future users of it. It would be safer if a separate
character array was used during each play back. However, as that will have
a performance impact it should be optional.</p>

<p>Ideally, it would be nice if Java had support for references to constant
arrays, to prevent this additional copying but it does not.</p>
