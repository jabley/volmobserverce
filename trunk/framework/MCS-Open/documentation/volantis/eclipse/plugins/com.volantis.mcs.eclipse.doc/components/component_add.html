    <p>In MCS, you can use a Component wizard to create project components. The wizard allows you to
      define:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A component name and its location in your project folders</li>
      <li>Related variants in the case of Image components</li>
      <li>Device targets for variants</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h2>Locating and naming a component</h2>
      <p>On the first page of the wizard, you can locate and name the component. Each component is a
        uniquely named file in your project. The policy tree view will be synchronized with your
        current project folder selection. After this page is complete, you can click
        <span class="command">Finish</span> and complete the information in the editor at a later time.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose <span class="command">File</span> | <span class="command">New</span> and choose a component type</li>
        <li>Choose the policy source directory in the tree view</li>
        <li>Enter the <span class="uicontrol">Component name</span>. MCS will automatically append the file
          extension when the file is created.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Specifying image variants</h2>
      <p>This wizard page applies only to selecting image variants from the file system. Refer to
          <em>Adding a variant</em> and follow the suggested steps. You should choose no more than
        one variant if you want to enable the <span class="command">Next</span> button and target any devices
        at this time.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Selection criteria</h2>
      <p>You can choose from
        'Targeted', 'Default', 'Generic' and 'Encoding', depending on the policy type.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a value of 'Targeted' in the <span class="uicontrol">Selection criteria</span> dropdown
          to enable the <span class="command">Next</span> button and refer to <em>Choosing a device</em> for information on targeting devices</li>
        <li>Otherwise make another selection and click <span class="command">Finish</span></li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Defining component attributes</h2>
      <p>Once the component is created, you can enter values for the component attributes in the
        Attributes section on the Overview page of the editor.</p>
      <p>You use the <span class="uicontrol">Device category policy</span> control to choose a set of policy
        values to use. Once you have selected a category, the
        policy options will appear in Category tab in the New Variant wizard.</p>
      <p> The remaining attributes are references to other components. The number of references will
        vary with the type of component you have created. For example, an image component has two
        fallback references for image and text.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><span class="command">Browse</span> the available custom device policy names to select a policy
          for this component.</li>
        <li>You can also <span class="command">Browse</span> to select fallback components in the Component
          Selection dialog. This view is filtered for the component type you need to select.</li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
      </ol>
