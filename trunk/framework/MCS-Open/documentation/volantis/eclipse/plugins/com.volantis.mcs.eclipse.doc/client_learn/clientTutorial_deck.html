      Hugson&amp;apos;s Siding at midnight, but it was already five
      o&amp;apos;clock and the gray dawn was breaking in the east when the little
      train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that served for the station-house.

              &lt;p&gt;The train from &amp;apos;Frisco was very late. It should have
                arrived at Hugson&amp;apos;s Siding at midnight, but it was already
                five o&amp;apos;clock and the gray dawn was breaking in the east
                when the little train slowly rumbled up to the open shed that
                served for the station-house. As it came to a stop the conductor
                called out in a loud voice:&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hugson&amp;apos;s Siding!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;At once a little girl rose from her seat and walked to the door of
                the car, carrying a wicker suit-case in one hand and a round
                bird-cage covered up with newspapers in the other, while a parasol
                was tucked under her arm. The conductor helped her off the car and
                then the engineer started his train again, so that it puffed and
                groaned and moved slowly away up the track. The reason he was
                so late was because all through the night there were times when
                the solid earth shook and trembled under him, and the engineer was 
                afraid that at any moment the rails might spread apart and an
                accident happen to his passengers. So he moved the cars slowly
                and with caution.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The little girl stood still to watch until the train had
                disappeared around a curve; then she turned to see where
                she was.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The shed at Hugson&amp;apos;s Siding was bare save for an old 
                wooden bench, and did not look very inviting. As she peered
                through the soft gray light not a house of any sort was visible near
                the station, nor was any person in sight; but after a while the child
                discovered a horse and buggy standing near a group of trees
                a short distance away. She walked toward it and found the horse
                tied to a tree and standing motionless, with its head hanging down
                almost to the ground. It was a big horse, tall and bony, with long
                legs and large knees and feet. She could count his ribs easily where
                they showed through the skin of his body, and his head was long
                and seemed altogether too big for him, as if it did not fit. His tail
                was short and scraggly, and his harness had been broken in many
                places and fastened together again with cords and bits of wire.
                The buggy seemed almost new, for it had a shiny top and side
                curtains. Getting around in front, so that she could look inside,
                the girl saw a boy curled up on the seat, fast asleep.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;She set down the bird-cage and poked the boy with her parasol.
                Presently he woke up, rose to a sitting position and rubbed his
                eyes briskly.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Hello!&amp;quot; he said, seeing her, &amp;quot;are you Dorothy
                Gale?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes,&amp;quot; she answered, looking gravely at his tousled
                hair and blinking gray eyes. &amp;quot;Have you come to take me to
                Hugson&amp;apos;s Ranch?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Of course,&amp;quot; he answered. &amp;quot;Train in?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I couldn&amp;apos;t be here if it wasn&amp;apos;t,&amp;quot; she
                said.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;He laughed at that, and his laugh was merry and frank. Jumping
                out of the buggy he put Dorothy&amp;apos;s suit-case under the seat
                and her bird-cage on the floor in front.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Canary-birds?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Oh no; it&amp;apos;s just Eureka, my kitten. I thought that was
                the best way to carry her.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The boy nodded.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Eureka&amp;apos;s a funny name for a cat,&amp;quot; he remarked.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I named my kitten that because I found it,&amp;quot; she
                explained. &amp;quot;Uncle Henry says &amp;apos;Eureka&amp;apos; means
                &amp;apos;I have found it.&amp;apos;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;All right; hop in.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;She climbed into the buggy and he followed her. Then the boy
                picked up the reins, shook them, and said &amp;quot;Gid-dap!&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The horse did not stir. Dorothy thought he just wiggled one of
                his drooping ears, but that was all.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Gid-dap!&amp;quot; called the boy, again.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The horse stood still.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Perhaps,&amp;quot; said Dorothy, &amp;quot;if you untied him,
                he would go.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The boy laughed cheerfully and jumped out.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Guess I&amp;apos;m half asleep yet,&amp;quot; he said, untying the
                horse. &amp;quot;But Jim knows his business all right - don&amp;apos;t you,
                Jim?&amp;quot; patting the long nose of the animal.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Then he got into the buggy again and took the reins, and the horse
                at once backed away from the tree, turned slowly around, and began
                to trot down the sandy road which was just visible in the dim light.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Thought that train would never come,&amp;quot; observed the boy.
                &amp;quot;I&amp;apos;ve waited at that station for five hours.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;We had a lot of earthquakes,&amp;quot; said Dorothy.
                &amp;quot;Didn&amp;apos;t you feel the ground shake?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes; but we&amp;apos;re used to such things in
                California,&amp;quot; he replied. &amp;quot;They don&amp;apos;t scare us
                much.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;The conductor said it was the worst quake he ever
                knew.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Did he? Then it must have happened while I was asleep,
                he said thoughtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How is Uncle Henry?&amp;quot; she enquired, after a pause
                during which the horse continued to trot with long, regular
                strides.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;He&amp;apos;s pretty well. He and Uncle Hugson have been
                having a fine visit.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Is Mr. Hugson your uncle?&amp;quot; she asked.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes. Uncle Bill Hugson married your Uncle Henry&amp;apos;s
                wife&amp;apos;s sister; so we must be second cousins,&amp;quot; said the
                boy, in an amused tone. &amp;quot;I work for Uncle Bill on his ranch,
                and he pays me six dollars a month and my board.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Isn&amp;apos;t that a great deal?&amp;quot; she asked,
                doubtfully.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Why, it&amp;apos;s a great deal for Uncle Hugson, but not for me.
                I&amp;apos;m a splendid worker. I work as well as I sleep,&amp;quot; he
                added, with a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;What is your name?&amp;quot; said Dorothy, thinking she liked the
                boy&amp;apos;s manner and the cheery tone of his voice.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Not a very pretty one,&amp;quot; he answered, as if a little
                ashamed. &amp;quot;My whole name is Zebediah; but folks just call me
                &amp;apos;Zeb.&amp;apos; You&amp;apos;ve been to Australia, haven&amp;apos;t
                you?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Yes; with Uncle Henry,&amp;quot; she answered. &amp;quot;We got to
                San Francisco a week ago, and Uncle Henry went right on to
                Hugson&amp;apos;s Ranch for a visit while I stayed a few days in the city
                with some friends we had met.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;How long will you be with us?&amp;quot; he asked.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Only a day. Tomorrow Uncle Henry and I must start back
                for Kansas. We&amp;apos;ve been away for a long time, you know,
                and so we&amp;apos;re anxious to get home again.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The boy flicked the big, boney horse with his whip and looked
                thoughtful. Then he started to say something to his little companion,
                but before he could speak the buggy began to sway dangerously
                from side to side and the earth seemed to rise up before them.
                Next minute there was a roar and a sharp crash, and at her side
                Dorothy saw the ground open in a wide crack and then come
                together again.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Goodness!&amp;quot; she cried, grasping the iron rail of
                the seat. &amp;quot;What was that?&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;That was an awful big quake,&amp;quot; replied Zeb,
                with a white face. &amp;quot;It almost got us that time,
                Dorothy.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The horse had stopped short, and stood firm as a rock. Zeb shook
                the reins and urged him to go, but Jim was stubborn. Then the boy
                cracked his whip and touched the animal&amp;apos;s flanks with it, and
                after a low moan of protest Jim stepped slowly along the road.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Neither the boy nor the girl spoke again for some minutes. There
                was a breath of danger in the very air, and every few moments the
                earth would shake violently. Jim&amp;apos;s ears were standing erect
                upon his head and every muscle of his big body was tense as he
                trotted toward home. He was not going very fast, but on his flanks
                specks of foam began to appear and at times he would tremble
                like a leaf.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The sky had grown darker again and the wind made queer
                sobbing sounds as it swept over the valley.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Suddenly there was a rending, tearing sound, and the earth
                split into another great crack just beneath the spot where the
                horse was standing. With a wild neigh of terror the animal fell
                bodily into the pit, drawing the buggy and its occupants after
                him.&lt;/p&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Dorothy grabbed fast hold of the buggy top and the boy
                did the same. The sudden rush into space confused them so
                that they could not think.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;Blackness engulfed them on every side, and in breathless silence
                they waited for the fall to end and crush them against jagged rocks
                or for the earth to close in on them again and bury them forever in
                its dreadful depths.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
            &lt;widget:deck-page&gt;
              &lt;p&gt;The horrible sensation of falling, the darkness and the terrifying
                noises, proved more than Dorothy could endure and for a few
                moments the little girl lost consciousness. Zeb, being a boy, did not
                faint, but he was badly frightened, and clung to the buggy seat with
                a tight grip, expecting every moment would be his last.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;/widget:deck-page&gt;
          &lt;/widget:deck&gt;
