    <p>While you use layouts to specify the physical position of elements on pages, you employ style
      rules, defined in the theme, for values such as, fonts, colors, backgrounds and borders. Each
      theme can have variants that you define for individual devices or groups of devices. Styles
      are device-dependent because devices differ greatly in the support available for this kind of
      information. So MCS has to identify the requesting device before applying a set of rules. Each
      variant is made up of a set of style rules, and each rule is identified by a selector, and has
      a set of properties.</p>
    <p>You use the Theme wizard and the Theme editor to associate variants with devices, and to
      define selectors and properties. You can also use the Style Rules view to get an overall
      picture of the themes for a particular theme variant, and perform some limited editing
      actions.</p>
    <p>As we did for the layouts, we will start by creating a theme policy, and then target a PC
      variant.</p>
