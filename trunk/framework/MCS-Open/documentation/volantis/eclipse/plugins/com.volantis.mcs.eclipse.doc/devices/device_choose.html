    <p>You can associate devices with variants, layouts and themes by selecting one or more devices
      from the device repository, and also by specifying custom device policy values that you have
      applied to devices.</p>
    <p>Different views of the available devices or policies are included on the final page in most
      component wizards, and in the Layout and Theme wizards.</p>
    <p>You can access the same views from the related editors when you set
      <span class="uicontrol">Criteria</span> to 'Targeted' and browse from the
      <span class="uicontrol">Target</span> control.</p>
    <p>If you have already created a layout or theme variant, and you open a device view, any device
      names that you have already selected are filtered from the view.</p>
    <p>The Target Selection interface contains two or three tabs. The Device List tab initially
      lists all the devices in the repository in alphanumeric order, and you can enter filter values
      to display a subset. The Device Tree tab shows the standard device hierarchy.</p>
    <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Device category policy</span> dropdown in the Attributes section for this
      policy shows all the device policy sets with single-select and boolean values, including
      custom device policies. If you have made a selection, the Device Category tab lists the policy
      values. Any selected targets are displayed in a consolidated list on all three tabs.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The <span class="uicontrol">Device category policy</span> setting applies to the
      entire component, layout or theme policy, and therefore to <em>all</em> the variants in it. If
      you change this setting after targeting some devices, you should review all the targeting
      values; otherwise they may not work as expected.</div>
    <p class="taskhead">In the wizard:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose 'Targeted' in the <span class="uicontrol">Selected criteria</span> dropdown</li>
      <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span> to go to the selection page</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="taskhead">In the editor:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a variant to enable the attribute controls</li>
      <li>Choose 'Targeted' in the <span class="uicontrol">Criteria</span> dropdown</li>
      <li>Click <span class="command">Browse</span> next to the <span class="uicontrol">Target</span> control to open
        the selection dialog</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="taskhead">In the selection interface:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Filter the Device List by name to display a standard device subset, or choose them from
        the Device Tree.</li>
      <li>To choose devices from a custom set, go to the Device Category tab and check the policy
        values to use</li>
    </ol>
    <p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: The filter text that you enter can contain wildcard characters. You use
      <span class="code">*</span> for any string, for example <span class="code">nok*</span> will return all patterns
      containing 'nokia'. You can also use <span class="code">?</span> for any single character, for example
        <span class="code">nokia?7???</span> will find Nokia series 7000 device names.</p>
