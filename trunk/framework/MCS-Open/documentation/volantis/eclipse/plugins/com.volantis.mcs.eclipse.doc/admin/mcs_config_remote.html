    <p>You configure remote policy cache values in the <span class="code">remote-policies</span> section of
      the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file.</p>
    <p>Remote policy cache values are specified differently from local policy cache values.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The cache values are default values that will be used by MCS if the remote server response
        does not contain cache directives.</li>
      <li>There is a single cache for all policies</li>
      <li>You can additionally define quotas that control the percentage of cache used by policies
        from each remote server</li>
      <li>Because there is a risk of network or server failure you can specify retry settings on the
        cache</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h2>Control and default settings</h2>
      <p>Cache attributes can be grouped into control and default sets. The control attribute values
        define either an upper or a lower limit for the default settings, or have the effect of
        allowing or disallowing each individual property.</p>
      <p>When an entry is added to the cache, the properties in the server response are checked
        against the control attribute values for the cache. Any that lie outside these limits are
        set to the equivalent control. For example, if an entry is added to the cache and its
          <span class="code">timeToLive</span> value exceeds the <span class="code">maxTimeToLive</span> control value, the
          <span class="code">maxTimeToLive</span> value is used. </p>
      <p>The attributes on the <span class="code">remote-policy-caches</span> values are global, and
        specific policy cache attributes, for example on the
        <span class="code">remote-audio-policy-cache</span> element, can be set to override them. MCS
        applies the same control tests whether values are taken from the individual policy cache
        defaults, or those on the <span class="code">remote-policy-caches</span> element. They are all
        subject to limitation by the corresponding control setting.</p>
      <p>For more information on remote policy cache attributes, refer to <em>remote policy cache</em>.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Evaluation of cache values</h2>
      <p>Cache settings are only evaluated when a variant is accessed. There is no separate process
        running that invalidates cache entries. So an item that expired an hour before it was
        accessed will only be removed from the cache when that access happens, unless it was removed
        to make space available for other items because it was the least recently used entry. It is
        therefore possible for invalid items to be in the cache, although they will never be used.</p>
      <p>If you leave the default settings that are shown in the example, and don't change any
        control values, each policy will be cached for 1 hour. If a request fails, MCS will then
        retry when the policy is next used, as long as it was at least 10 minutes after the previous
        failed request. To invalidate the cache, the control value <span class="code">maxTimeToLive</span> must
        be non-zero.</p>
      <pre class="code">
&lt;remote-policies&gt;
  &lt;remote-policy-cache
    cachePolicies="true"
    defaultTimeToLive="3600"
    defaultRetryFailedRetrieval="true"
    defaultRetryInterval="600"
    defaultRetryMaxCount="5"
    defaultRetainDuringRetry="true"
    maxCacheSize="1000"
    maxTimeToLive="0"
    allowRetryFailedRetrieval="true"
    minRetryInterval="0"
    maxRetryMaxCount="10"
    allowRetainDuringRetry="true"
&lt;/remote-policies&gt;</pre>
    
    
      <h2>Retry configuration</h2>
      <p>A high proportion of the cache element attributes are there to handle error conditions
        caused by remote server or network problems. The cache process tries to limit the impact of
        such failures by eliminating unnecessary remote requests where possible. Where a cached
        policy has expired, and an attempt to update the value has failed, the retry attributes of
        the entry are used. If the policy is not cached, an entry is added to the cache with the
        default retry values for the cache concerned.</p>
      <p>If retry is enabled and you have set the <span class="code">allowRetainDuringRetry</span> attribute to
        'true', MCS will continue to use the cached policy even if it is invalid according to other
        cache attributes, such as the time to live period. Retries will occur when a page references
        the policy, the retry interval has expired and the maximum retry count has not been
        exceeded. MCS will use these retry values whether or not there is a cache entry for a
        policy. Once the maximum retry count is reached, the policy is marked as unavailable, and
        will remain so until it is purged from the cache.</p>
      <p>If retry is disabled and a policy is in the cache, MCS marks the policy as unavailable. If
        this entry is subsequently deleted, MCS will attempt to access the policy on the remote
        server again, but there is no certainty that this will happen.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Using cache quotas</h2>
      <p>Quota values help prevent cached entries from any one remote server from dominating the
        cache.</p>
      <p>You specify a quota value for a server using its URL prefix and identify a folder. You
        specify the quota for a folder as a percentage of the maximum cache size. This allows cache
        sizes to be modified without the quotas necessarily having to be changed.</p>
      <p>MCS uses the percentage value to control the number of entries cached in the folder and all
        its sub folders. When the addition of an cache entry will cause a quota to be exceeded, MCS
        removes enough least recently used items to make space for the new entry.</p>
      <p>You do not have to specify any quotas. It is not necessary for the quota values to add up
        to 100%. Neither is it necessary to specify quotas for all folders; you can apply quotas
        only for entries in some subset of the folders in the cache.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If the total set of specified quotas is more than 100%, performance may
        degrade as the cache nears the limit placed on its size.</div>
      <p>In the <span class="code">remote-policy-quotas</span> element there can be one
          <span class="code">remote-policy-quota</span> element for each server, whose attributes define
        the quota for one URL prefix.</p>
      <p>For performance reasons, nested quotas are not allowed. When a folder has been given a
        quota, an additional quota on any of its sub folders will be ignored.</p>
      <p>The example divides the allocation of space in the <span class="code">remote-policy-quotas</span>
        element equally between polices from two remote server URLs. If the
        <span class="code">maxCacheSize</span> attribute of the cache is set to 500, MCS will allow up to 250
        entries for policies from the folder and its sub folders specified for each server. Other
        policies are unlimited.</p>
