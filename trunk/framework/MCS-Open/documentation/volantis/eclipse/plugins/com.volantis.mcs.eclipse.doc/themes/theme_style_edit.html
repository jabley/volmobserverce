    <p>In the tree view below the Selector list you can choose one of the categories or
      sub-categories of style properties, and set the related properties. You can select only one
      category at a time. When you choose a category, the edit controls are enabled. The available
      controls depend on your selection.</p>
    <p>Some properties have a <span class="command">Browse</span> button that opens a selection dialog, such a
      font or component list, where you can choose values.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select a category in the tree.</li>
      <li>Choose properties from the drop-down or dialog.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The properties are added to the selector.</p>
    
      <h2>Importance and inheritance</h2>
      <p>All the properties in a category have a checkbox that you can use to set or unset the CSS
          <span class="uicontrol">!important</span> value for the property. You can use
          <span class="uicontrol">!important</span> to override default browser or user settings on a
        device.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Not all browsers comply with this CSS feature. The MCS device repository
        contains settings to rectify this problem where it is known.</div>
      <p>Drop-down lists always contain the value 'Inherit' as one of the options. 'Inherit' means
        that the value of this property will be inherited automatically for the containing XDIME
        element.</p>
      <p>You can also set these values for all the properties in a category.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Select a category in the tree.</li>
        <li>Right click and choose <span class="command">Set All to !Important</span> or <span class="command">Set All to
            Inherit</span>.</li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Multiple values</h2>
      <p>Some CSS properties can be set with 'shorthand' values. For example, although you can set
        the border width properties of a table individually, it is also possible to set all four
        width values with the single shorthand statement, <span class="code">border-width: 1px;</span>. In these
        cases MCS uses a single category, and displays an <span class="uicontrol">All</span> control where
        you can set the value, as well as the individual properties.</p>
      <p>Other controls combine pairs of properties, for example horizontal and vertical positions.
        If you set one value in a pair to 'Inherit' MCS sets the other value to 'Inherit' as well.</p>
      <p>Another combination is where you need to set a numeric value and the unit of measurement,
        for example, an amount for spacing and the unit as '50 pixels'. In these cases MCS displays
        two drop-downs.</p>
