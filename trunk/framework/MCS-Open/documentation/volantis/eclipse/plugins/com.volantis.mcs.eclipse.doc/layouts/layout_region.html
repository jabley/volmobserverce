    <p>Portals are web sites that combine material from a variety of sources into a single
      presentation. They provide a focal point for information delivery but do not control all of
      the material that they deliver. </p>
    <p>Each page is a template with some common content and a set of areas that can be occupied by
      variable content. The areas are known as regions. The content that occupies a region is known
      as a portlet.</p>
    
    <p>You cannot position multiple portlets within a single region. If you include several portlets
      MCS will display them sequentially. If you need to separate portlet content, you should create
      individual regions for each portlet.</p>
