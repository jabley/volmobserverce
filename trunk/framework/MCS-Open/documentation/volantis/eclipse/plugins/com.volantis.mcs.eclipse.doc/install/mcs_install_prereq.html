    <p>MCS requires a repository which stores MCS policies for device, digital asset and stylistic
      information. This is implemented at design time as a set of XML files. If you wish to
      implement a database repository for runtime deployment, you must have a JDBC or relational
      database client installed, configured and working correctly before you can use the MCS
      software.</p>
    <p>A web application server needs to be installed and working before you can view any MCS
      generated pages. You may generate the pages without the web application server being installed
      but you will not be able to view them. You can also use the policy editors, to view and update
      the repository, without a web application server being installed.</p>
    <p>If you want to use MCS with a web application server, the web application server should be
      installed and configured before you install the MCS software. This will allow the MCS
      configuration file to be updated correctly by the installer, avoiding the need to set the
      configuration for the web application server manually.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: A full list of supported platforms for development and runtime environments is
      contained in <em>Supported platforms</em> in <em>MCS Release notes</em> (PDF).</div>
    
      <h2>Eclipse framework</h2>
      <p>The MCS policy editors operate within the open-source Eclipse Framework.</p>
      <p>Download and install a supported version of Eclipse,
        following the instructions from <em>Eclipse downloads</em>. Ensure that
        you install the Release Build SDK for your chosen platform.</p>
      <p>A set of plugins for the MCS policy editors are created during installation. These will
        need to be copied to the appropriate Eclipse plugins
        directory. See <em>Completing the installation</em> for details.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Database server</h2>
      <p>The database must be available to any computer on which the MCS server runtime is
        installed. You can install a database on the same computer as the MCS components, or on a
        different computer.</p>
      <p>Your database server should be installed with the appropriate services started. Refer to
        the appropriate database documentation for all products.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Web application server</h2>
      <p>A wide variety of web application servers can be used with MCS. <em>Setting up your web server</em> contains several examples.</p>
      <p>Environment variables, as described in the installation guide for each web application
        server, will need to be set before installation.</p>
      <p>If you have the JDK or JRE already installed you can test your web application server using
        the test instructions supplied with the server.</p>
      <p>Refer to the appropriate application server documentation for all products.</p>
