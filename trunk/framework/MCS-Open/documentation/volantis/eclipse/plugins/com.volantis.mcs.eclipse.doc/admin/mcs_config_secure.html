    <p>MCS can host multiple Secure Publishing Server (SPS) instances using a Secure Connection
      Server (SCS) as an HTTP proxy server for a host MCS service. It supports the proxying of both
      HTTP and HTTPS requests, and maintains a list of HTTP 1.0 and 1.1 connections and the
      associated URLs.</p>
    <p>When the connection server receives a HTTP Proxy request from MCS or another HTTP client it
      compares the URL from the request with the list of established connections. If the URL is not
      in the table it will proxy a request to the URL specified. If the beginning of the URL matches
      one in the connection list, SCS will make the request using this connection to the SPS. The
      SPS in turn makes the request to a local web application server.</p>
    <p>Each SPS is configured with a username and password, which it will use to make a connection
      to the SCS. If authentication is achieved, the connection will remain open enabling the SCS to
      make requests. The SPS periodically sends a keep alive message to the SCS to maintain the
      connection through stateful firewalls, the period of this keep alive can be configured at the
      SPS, with a default and minimum value obtained from the SCS to prevent DOS attacks. </p>
    
      <h2>Remote projects</h2>
      <p>You can register a remote project with MCS and use it to serve pages using a URL that
        specifies where the project resources are published. Once you have registered a project and
        published some content, XDIME pages and MCS policies can be accessed using that URL.</p>
      <p>MCS handles remote project information by remapping a request to the URL of a resource
        server. For example, if a request is for the URL
          <span class="filepath">http://www.projectserver.com/remoteProject/news.xdime</span>, and the
        servlet path <span class="filepath">remoteProject</span> has been registered against the URL
          <span class="filepath">http://remote.com/myproject/mobile/resources</span>, the remote page
          <span class="filepath">http://remote.com/myproject/mobile/resources/news.xdime</span> will be
        served.</p>
      <p>MCS includes a public API that allows you to implement remapping, and includes a default
        implementation of this interface. The <span class="code">RemoteProjectURLRemapper</span> interface
        contains a single method, <span class="code">URL remap(String requestURL, String servletPath)</span>.</p>
      <p>The location of the remapping servlet is defined in the web.xml file.</p>
      
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Policy resources in remote projects that are referenced directly in the
        markup using relative references will always be loaded. However, if a policy being accessed
        uses a theme which defines an MCS component, the URI must be fully qualified in order to be
        retrieved. The URL remapping is carried out for each XDIME page, and all relative references
        in that page are assumed to be in the same project.</div>
