    <p>MCS uses caching in order to avoid accessing the repository for policies that have been
      retrieved recently. All variants are cached with their containing policies.</p>
    <p>You can configure caching in the <span class="code">policy-cache</span> section of the
        <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file by setting global cache values to optimize
      performance.</p>
    <pre class="code">
&lt;policy-cache&gt;
  &lt;asset-group-cache
    enabled="true"
    max-entries="25"
    timeout="3600"/&gt;
&lt;/policy-cache&gt;</pre>
    
      <h2>Setting cache attributes</h2>
      <p>You define cache settings by editing <span class="code">policy-cache</span> attribute values. You
        can set up values for each type of object, and then switch them on or off with the
          <span class="code">enabled</span> attribute. On a production server you should set all policy caches to
        'true'; on a development server you may wish to switch off some caches so that any changes
        you make to content are effective immediately.</p>
      <p>Each item in the cache has a count that is incremented when MCS accesses the object, and a
        record of the time of last access. MCS always removes the 10 least recently used items.</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">max-entries</span> attribute defines the default number of entries in each cache.
        If you don't specify a value, or set it to '-1', no size limit is set. Asset groups, images
        and layouts may need the most space in the policy cache, whereas themes may require a
        relatively smaller cache. For devices, remember to allow for growth in the device
        repository.</p>
      <p>When an item is requested from the cache MCS checks the <span class="code">timeout</span> attribute,
        which specifies the default number of seconds an item can remain in the cache. If the item
        has timed out, MCS removes it from the cache and requests the item from the repository. The
        new item is then cached. This means that, although items may have timed out, they will still
        exist in the cache until accessed.</p>
      <p>You can use the timeout feature to force the cache to update items which may have changed
        in the repository during run time. It is not intended as a device for resizing the cache
        after a certain time period. If you don't specify a <span class="code">timeout</span> value, or set it to
        -1, a cache will be created where none of the items timeout.</p>
      
      
        <h2>Factors affecting cache size</h2>
      <p>There is no exact formula for calculating the size of a cache. There is one cache entry for
        each policy, and each policy includes all the variants in a component, and the variants
        selected for each device. Also the size of the cache depends on the number of requests for
        the individual policies. Layout and theme policies take the most space, as well as being the
        most frequently requested. Otherwise cache entries are quite small, so increasing the
        setting of <span class="code">max-entries</span> attribute value will not use large amounts of
      memory.</p>
