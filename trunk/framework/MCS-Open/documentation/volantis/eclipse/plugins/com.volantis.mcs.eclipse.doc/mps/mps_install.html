    <p>The MPS installer collects the values required to configure channel adapters for several
      protocols, the installation location, and the details for locating the files needed by the WAP
      push channel adapter.</p>
    
      <h2>Before you install</h2>
      <p>You will need to install the following supporting software and MCS policies before you can
        use MPS.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You need to <strong>install MCS</strong>. Refer to the topics on installing MCS for details.</li>
        <li>You should have an <strong>MCS repository</strong> installed and working to be able to use MPS
          with MCS. </li>
        <li>The <strong>JavaMail</strong> package (javax.mail) and the <strong>JavaBeans Activation Framework</strong>
          (javax.activation) used by the JavaMail API to manage MIME data. Both are available from
          http://java.sun.com.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Optionally, you can also install:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <strong>JavaMail SMTP</strong> protocol provider for the JavaMail API that provides access to
          an SMTP server, available from http://java.sun.com</li>
        <li>The <strong>Nokia MMSC</strong> protocol used for communication with Nokia MMSC. This is available
          as the package com.nokia.mms from http://www.forum.nokia.com. The file is
            <span class="filepath">nokia_mmsdriver_1.5.jar</span>. </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If one of the SMTP, MMSC or SMSC JAR files is not in the classpath, and/or
        one of the channels is not configured correctly this will prevent messages from being
        delivered and may cause internal problems for the application server. For this reason each
          <span class="code">channel</span> element in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file is
        commented out until you specifically enable it.</div>
    
    
      <h2>Running the installer</h2>
      <p>The installation wizard steps you through a series of pages containing settings that
        correspond to the <span class="code">channel</span> element attributes in the
        <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file. You can edit this file at any time after installation if you need to change the
        settings.</p>
      <p>All the installer values have defaults. When you have completed a section, click
          <span class="command">Next</span> to move to the next page, or click <span class="command">Previous</span> to
          review or modify any values.</p>
      <p>When the installation is complete you can choose to save an automated installation file at a
        convenient location. Then you can repeat the installation on another machine with the path to
        the configuration file as a parameter.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start the installer with the command <pre class="code">
java -jar mps_installer-5.1.jar</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Accept the license agreement</li>
        <li>Choose the packs to install </li>
        <li>Configure the SMTP channel adapter with the <span class="uicontrol">Host</span> name. If the
            <span class="uicontrol">Server requires authorization</span>, check the option and add
            <span class="uicontrol">Username</span> and <span class="uicontrol">Password</span> settings.</li>
        <li>Configure SMSC, MMSC and WAP Push channel adapters in the same way</li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Browse</span> to choose the install location. MPS must be installed in
          the same directory as MCS.</li>
        <li>Verify the installation settings and click <span class="command">Next</span> to complete the
          installation</li>
        <li>Optionally save your installation settings by clicking <span class="command">Generate an automatic
          installation script</span>, and naming the file. To repeat the installation run the
          following command. <pre class="code">
java -jar mps_installer-5.1.jar [configuration_file]</pre></li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Done</span> to complete the installation</li>
      </ol>
