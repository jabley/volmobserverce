    <p>A canvas is a layout area where you can position formatting objects and associate them with
      elements in your web content. On a PC, MCS delivers a canvas as a single web page. On smaller
      devices, MCS sends complex canvasses as sets of pages.</p>
    <p>The figure shows a canvas layout, designed to display help text on a PC, as it appears in
      the Design page of the Layout editor.</p>
    <p>An outer grid consists of two columns. The left column contains another grid with three
      panes for sections in a table of contents, and the right column contains a single pane for
      topics. </p>
    <p>MCS displays the content in individual panes. Since there are four panes, and four places
      where content can be displayed, each pane has a unique name within the layout. In the content,
      you use the pane names to specify where output from XDIME elements appears. </p>
    <p><img src="../graphics/layout_canvas.png" alt="A canvas layout with panes" title="A canvas layout with panes"/></p>
    <p>You assign attributes to each format, including every pane. These attributes determine the
      formatting that is applied as the page is generated. For example, you might decide to center
      the layout of each of the table of contents panes and left align the Topic content. </p>
    <p>MCS flows content in normal panes, so headings and paragraphs, and lists will format on the
      page as you expect.</p>
    <p>When you add a pane and name it, you are creating a target for part of the content. You use
      the theme for the page to target content at a specific pane. In the example a paragraph is
      mapped to the pane named Topic using the <span class="code">class</span> attribute.</p>

&lt;p class="Topic"&gt;The Multi-Channel
  Server (MCS) helps you manage the complexity of delivering a
  wide variety of content to PCs, PDAs, mobile phones,
  interactive digital TV, internet appliances, games consoles,
  VoiceXML and interactive kiosks.&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
