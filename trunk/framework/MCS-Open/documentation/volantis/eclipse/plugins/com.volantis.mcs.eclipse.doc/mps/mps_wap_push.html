    <p>MPS ships with a message store servlet (MSS) that uses the WAP Push channel adapter
      (WAPPushChannelAdapter). The servlet caches XML messages using an identifier and later
      retrieves them using the identifier as a parameter to the request. MSS demonstrates the use of
      the Custom Channel Adapter API, and is described here. For specific WAP push server
      applications, you will need to adapt the code.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To enable WAP push, you must uncomment the WAP push channel in the
        <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file.</div>
    <p>WAP Push does not send content in the message, but instead sends the URL of the page
      containing the message to the device in the subject of an SMS message. The user of the device
      can then pull the content down at a convenient time.</p>
    <p>MPS handles WAP Push messages according to their type.</p>
    <p>Because a JSP message is already in the form of a URL, this URL is used as the subject of the
      SMS message.</p>
    
    <p>XML Messages have no associated URL, so MSS stores the message and builds a URL that is
      sent to the device using the WAP push adapter. The URL consists of the fully qualified path to
      the servlet, and an appended identifier that is unique in this instance of the servlet
      context. To retrieve a message, MSS uses the identifier in the HTTP request from the device.</p>
    <p>One XML message is stored for each device type until the client pulls the message from the
      message storage servlet. </p>
    <p>If you need to push a message to the device using Service Load, you can override a Service
      Indication by using the <span class="code">addHeader</span> method of the <span class="code">MultiChannelMessage</span>
      class to add a special header 'X-WAP-Push-Type' that may have a value of 'SL' or 'SI'. If the
      header value is invalid then 'SI' is assumed.</p>
    <pre class="code">addHeader(ALL,"X-WAP-Push-Type","SL")</pre>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Service Indications are alerts with a click-able link. Service Loads are
      alerts that also automatically deliver the content to the device.</div>
    
      <h2>Storing and retrieving messages</h2>
      <p>To store an XML message, MPS sends an HTTP POST request to the MSS servlet with the single
        parameter 'xml' containing the XDIME XML to execute.</p>
      <p>The MSS servlet generates a page identifier in a secure manner, and returns the page
        identified in the response header 'xmlid'.</p>
      <p>To retrieve a stored message a simple HTTP GET request is made to the MSS servlet with a
        'pageId' parameter containing the previously-generated page identifier, for example:</p>
      <pre class="code">http://myhost:8080/[context_root]/mss?pageid=xmlid</pre>
    
    
      <h2>Configuring the message store</h2>
      <p>The MSS servlet can be configured on either the same host as the MPS installation or on a
        different machine.</p>
      
      <p>Because WAP Push messages need to be persisted on a web server until users can retrieve
        them, MPS provides configurable message caching. All messages will persist in the storage
        servlet for the period you specify. Messages are stored in the message store directory
        specified in the configuration of the servlet, and persist over a restart of the servlet
        until they are expired.</p>
      <p>The message store, which MPS uses to cache WAP push messages until they are retrieved by
        users, is configured in the <span class="filepath">mss-config.xml</span> file. This file, and the
        related XML schema and log4j files (also prefixed 'mss') will be in the locations you
        specified when you installed MPS. The default directory is <span class="filepath">WEB-INF</span>.</p>
      <p>Two <span class="code">init-param</span> elements in the <span class="filepath">web.xml</span> file give
        the paths to the MSS configuration file and the log4j file. The <span class="code">param-name</span>
        attribute names the file and the <span class="code">param-value</span> attribute gives the path
        information.</p>
      <p>The <span class="code">messageStoreServer</span> element contains the configuration definition.</p>
      <pre class="code">
&lt;messageStoreServer&gt;
  &lt;message-store
    location="[path]\webapps\[context_root]\mss_store"
    timeout="unlimited"
    id-size="12"
    validate="false"/&gt;
&lt;/messageStoreServer&gt;</pre>
      <p>The <span class="code">message-store</span> element contains the cache settings. The
          <span class="code">location</span> attribute contains the absolute path to the directory used by the
        message store server. The <span class="code">timeout</span> attribute sets the period in seconds that a
        cache entry will be retained, or the text value 'unlimited'. The <span class="code">id-size</span>
        attribute is the length in characters (minimum 10) of the generated message identifier. The
          <span class="code">validate</span> attribute determines whether the XML message should be validated
        before storage.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You will probably want to set the <span class="code">timeout</span> attribute to a high
        value, giving users plenty of time to retrieve a message. The message store server checks
        this value at five-minute intervals, so you should set it as a multiple of 300 seconds. </div>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: From MPS 3.3, the <span class="code">environment</span> element is obsolete; it
        will be removed in a later version of the <span class="filepath">mss-config.xml</span> file. If the
        location is specified here, a warning message will be logged and the location will not be
        used. </div>
