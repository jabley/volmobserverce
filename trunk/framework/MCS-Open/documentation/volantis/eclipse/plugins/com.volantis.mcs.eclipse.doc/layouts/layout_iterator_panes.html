    <p>If you need to present sets of results from a dynamic data source, or a layout in which the
      content changes over time, you can use a format iterator.</p>
    <p>Spatial iterators handle tables with both fixed and variable numbers of rows from a database
      query or a web search engine.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Using column and row iterators is deprecated from MCS 3.2. They will be
      removed in a later release of MCS. Nested menus are not supported in column and row iterator
      panes.</div>
    <p>A temporal iterator allows you to create a time-based, sequences for use with the Message
      Preparation Sever (MPS).</p>
    
      <h2>Spatial iteration</h2>
      <p>A spatial iterator defines both rows and columns in a single format. You can specify either
        an exact number of iterations or an upper limit, and also define the order of indexing the
        generated panes - rows or columns first. A single pane defines the content.</p>
      
    
    
      <h2>Using iterators in a grid</h2>
      <p>The figure shows how a spatial iterator and its content appear in a Layout editor Design
        page. The grid contains a row of three panes. Named 'isbn', 'title', and 'price', which act
        as column template definitions for information in a booklist.</p>
      <p><img src="../graphics/layout_spatial.png" alt="Spatial iterator" title="Spatial iterator"/></p>
      <p>MCS populates this layout from XDIME using the CSS expression function
          <span class="code">mcs-container-instance()</span> in the theme to refer to the iterated instances of
        the panes. Refer to <em>XDIME 2 in layouts</em> for a detailed example.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: MCS does not generate tables for layout grid items in WML because they are
        output with borders on most devices.</div>
    
    
      <h2>Temporal iteration</h2>
      <p>Temporal iterators work in a similar way to spatial iterators. The associated attributes
        define the transition between presentation of one set of content and the next.</p>
      <p>In the preceding example the booklist pane instances could be associated with time
        intervals. This might not be effective in a text-only presentation, but it would make sense
        if the content was a series of book cover images.</p>
      <p>This kind of indexing can also be used in MPS messages, to present information in a
        sequence of pages on devices with small displays.</p>
