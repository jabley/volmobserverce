    <p>Welcome to Volantis Mobility Server 5.1â„¢.</p>
    <p><em>Getting started</em> is a beginner's guide, which will help you get rolling with your first
      mobile site. It covers the install and deploy process for a simple
      development system, and describes a welcome page that you can run 'out of the box' and access
      from both PC systems and mobile devices. We show how this page is constructed using XDIME 2
      markup, and how it works with the device independent policy information to render your content
      for a range of devices.</p>
    
    <p>When you have finished, we suggest that you follow the tutorial <em>Next steps with MCS</em>.
      It is based on a more complex site, with its own set of resources. It goes into more detail
      about the creation of projects, components, layouts and themes. It also takes you through the
      construction of a wider range XDIME 2 pages with more code examples. </p>
    <p>Each tutorial module describes one main task. In each module step-by-step sections guide you
      through the process till the task is completed. All the materials used in this guide and the
      tutorials are shipped and installed with MCS. </p>  <h2>Policies</h2><p>Volantis Mobility Server adapts page content
      to multiple device characteristics. The adaptation is driven by policies, and a large database
      of device attributes.</p><p>Policies describe the individual pieces of information that MCS needs to render pages that
      match the devices used by a range of users. By applying different policies, you can
      distinguish between 'device-specific' and 'device-independent' information. This policy based
      separation enables quicker, easier maintenance as well as rapid implementation.</p><p>The first part of <em>Getting started</em> explains the process of creating a project, an image
      component, a layout, and theme for the welcome page. You will use the Eclipse IDE to edit
      policies.</p><h2>XDIME</h2><p>The second part of this guide introduces XDIME markup (XHTML Device Independent Markup
      Extensions). XDIME 2 is a standards based XML vocabulary, using familiar elements from XHTML
      and XForms. This makes it very easy to create XDIME content if you already know these
      languages.</p><p>We assume that you have a working knowledge of XHTML 1. Where XDIME differs from XHTML, we
      have highlighted it in the topic <em>Migrating to XDIME</em>. Usually this is because
      XDIME adopts some conventions from the emerging XHTML 2 standard.</p><p>XForms is a relatively new W3C recommendation. We touch on forms only briefly in this
      tutorial, illustrating a way to respond to form input with a JSP. We encourage you to move on
      to study the forms topics in the XDIME documentation. Refer to the <em>Working with XForms</em> tutorial for further
      information.</p><p>We also show how to configure MCS so that you can process content from a remote site that
      renders XDIME from a PHP or Ruby framework, and demonstrate how to 'print' a sample 'Hello'
      page in both languages.</p></body></html>
