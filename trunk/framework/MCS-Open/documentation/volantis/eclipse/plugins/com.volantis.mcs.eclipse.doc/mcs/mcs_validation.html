    <p>When MCS validates the content of work you have done, it reports any problems. What you see
      depends on the situation.</p>
    
      <h2>Policy editor errors</h2>
      <p>In the Alerts and Action Items section of a policy editor, the error information is updated
        each time you make a change. For example when you add a new variant to a component, MCS
        validates the change and reports on any required attributes that are missing. As you enter
        valid attribute data the list changes until there are no errors showing.</p>
      <p>If there are any current errors, you'll see a link to the relevant items in the Problems
        view, for example, 'There are 2 errors 0, warnings and 3 tasks associated with this theme'.
        You can click on the link to highlight the items in the problem list. If there are no
        errors, you'll see 'No alerts at this time'.</p>

      <h2>Errors in the Problems view</h2>
      <p>The same problems are also included in the workbench Problems view. If the Problems view is
        closed when MCS first reports an error, MCS opens the view to show the problem.</p>
      <p><img src="../graphics/mcs_list_error.png" alt="Problems view with MCS errors" title="Problems view with MCS errors"/></p>
      <p>The Problems list contains all the outstanding items that need your attention. When you
        select an MCS resource and right click <span class="command">Go To</span>, MCS brings the resource tab
        to the front (or opens the editor if it is closed), and highlights the control where the
        problem is.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Errors in dialogs</h2>
      <p>Errors in dialogs are shown by text in the body of the dialog.</p>

    <p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: In the Navigator and Package Explorer views, MCS error markers propagate right
      up to project level, so you can spot problems even if an editor is not open on a resource, a
      folder is closed, or the Problems view is hidden or closed.</p>
