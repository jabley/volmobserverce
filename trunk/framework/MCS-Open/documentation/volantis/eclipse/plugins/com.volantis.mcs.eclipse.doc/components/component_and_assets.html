    <p>MCS allows you to separate content and presentation by providing device-independent elements
      for use in layouts. However, some resources are highly device-specific. Images are a good
      example. The size, color, rendering and even the type of an image may need to vary for
      different devices. Mobile phones, for example, can require special image formats.</p>
    <p>MCS manages the relationship between device-independent content and device-dependent data by
      using components and variants.</p>
    <p>For example, an image component can refer to a set of image files, or variants, that
      individually fit the profiles of several different devices. The attributes of each variant are
      contained in the component. In a web page, the <span class="code">object</span> element in the XDIME
      2 markup contains the name of the image component in its <span class="code">src</span> attribute. When a
      device requests the page, MCS uses the image attributes to select the best image variant to
      display on the device.</p>
    
      <h2>Creating and editing components</h2>
    
    <p>In MCS, you use the New Policy wizard to name components in your project, locate them, and
      define attributes or fallback values that refer to other components.</p>
    <p>You use one of the MCS component editors to add variants to a component and define the
      variant attributes.</p>
