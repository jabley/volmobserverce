    <p>Only simple XDIME elements are supported in MHTML, so you cannot use structural elements such
      as <span class="code">table</span> or <span class="code">div</span>.</p>
    <p>In MMS and SMS, whitespace is significant, so MPS renders element body content using
      whitespace to layout the message.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>All line feeds and unnecessary spaces are trimmed from element contents, apart from the
          <span class="code">pre</span> element </li>
      <li>A line break is placed in the output text before and after most block level elements </li>
      <li>Whitespace is added around text for <span class="code">td</span>, <span class="code">th</span> and
          <span class="code">dt</span> elements to approximate columns </li>
      <li>The <span class="code">ol</span> and <span class="code">ul</span> elements are also emulated, but only
        in the most simple cases, and any attributes are ignored </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Other issues and features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Nested elements in table cells such as <span class="code">p</span> may break the emulated
        formatting </li>
      <li>All form content is ignored </li>
      <li>Character encodings not supported in MMS/SMS will produce undefined results </li>
      <li>No support is provided for inclusion </li>
      <li>Any HTML entities are ignored and passed through </li>
      <li>All theme and style information is ignored </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Several limitations in the use of layouts, themes and components in MPS messages are given in
      the table.</p>
    <table cellspacing="0" summary="Limitations in the use of layouts, themes and components in MPS messages"><caption>Layouts, themes and components</caption><thead><tr><th class="firsthdr" scope="col">Type  </th><th scope="col">Layout  </th><th scope="col">Themes  </th><th scope="col">Components  </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th class="firstcell">MHTML  </th><td>Layouts should be simple  </td><td>HTML 3.2 does not support CSS. MCS emulates some CSS properties for HTML 3.2 family
            protocols by mapping theme policies to individual element attributes.  </td><td>No differences  </td></tr><tr><th class="firstcell">MMS  </th><td>A maximum of two panes, with separate panes for text and images if both are used.
              <span class="uicontrol">Destination Area</span> format attribute for the pane must contain the
            case sensitive literal 'Text' or 'Image'.  </td><td rowspan="2">All theme information is ignored.  </td><td rowspan="2">Text fallbacks are used for unsupported non-text components if
          available  </td></tr><tr><th class="firstcell">SMS  </th><td>A single pane only is allowed  </td></tr></tbody></table>
    
      <h2>Additional features over MCS</h2>
      <p>Where a device natively supports the AMR audio format (audio/amr and audio/x-amr), you can
        use device specific audio assets with the XDIME <span class="code">audio</span> element.</p>
      <p>On MMS/SMIL devices, it is possible to associate an individual audio component with each
        slide in an MMS slide presentation. For example, in a message canvas containing several
        slides timed by a temporal iterator, if there are two panes in the iterator layout (one
        text, one image) above one another, and an audio component is bound to <em>either</em> pane,
        the audio will be played when the layout is displayed as a single slide. Under MHTML/SMS any
        alternative text is output.</p>
      <pre class="code">
&lt;canvas layoutName="iter8" theme="beaches.mthm"&gt;
  &lt;!--slide 1--&gt;
  &lt;p pane="text1"&gt;Waikiki beach, Oahu&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;audio pane="text1" src="/sounds/uke1.mauc"/&gt;
  &lt;p pane="image1"&gt;
    &lt;img src="/graphics/waikiki.mimg"/&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;!--more slides--&gt;
&lt;/canvas&gt;</pre>
    
    
      <h2>MCS features not available with MPS</h2>
      <p>Fragmentation, which is available with MCS, is not supported within MPS messages. Page
        generation will fail for layouts that are fragmented.</p>
      <p>Dissection, which is available with MCS, is not supported within MPS messages. During page
        generation, dissecting panes are treated as normal panes and dissection is suppressed.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Error detection</h2>
      <p>The error detection features that are available in MPS are channel dependent. If a protocol
        supports a particular error condition, then the error values will be returned by the
        appropriate adapter.</p>
