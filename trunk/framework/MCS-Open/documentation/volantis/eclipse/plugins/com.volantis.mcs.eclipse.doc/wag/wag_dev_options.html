      <p>The separation of policy and device information in MCS means that developers can use a
        personal, self-contained environment where they have their own XML repository and a local
        installation of MCS. Development and testing can therefore take place wherever they are
        located. It is also possible to support a local JDBC installation or to access a remote
        database.</p>
      <p>Self-contained working is a good option for remote, individual or small team development
        whereby developers work on their own projects and policies, and do not need access to other
        developer’s resources.</p>
    <p>After testing, the finished application or policy updates maybe deployed to a central XML or
      database repository. It would be more typical to deploy to a database to take advantage of
      underlying scaleability and data sharing capabilities.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: An XML repository is single-user only and is not deployed to shared file
      systems.</div>
