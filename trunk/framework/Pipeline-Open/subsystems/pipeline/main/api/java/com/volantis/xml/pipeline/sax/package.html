Provides classes and interfaces for the XML pipeline.

<h2 id="contextual-information">Contextual Information</h2>

<p>Due to the dynamic nature of the pipeline it is not possible for processes to
reliably access contextual information that is normally made available within
the event stream, e.g. namespace / prefix mappings and xml:base attributes. This
is because the process may have been added after the information was sent down
the pipeline but before it was overridden by any nested events. Therefore,
processes must retrieve this information from the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.XMLPipelineContext}.</p>

<h3>Updating Context</h3>

<p>In order for processes to be able to access the information from the context
it first needs to be added to the context and that is the responsibility of the
context updating process. Any event source that generates a standard SAX event
sequence must pass the events through a context updating process before they
enter the pipeline, e.g. XSLT Transfomer, XMLPipelineReader,
XMLPipelineFilter, ....</p>
<p>Context updating processes can be created using the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.XMLPipelineFactory#createContextUpdatingProcess}
method.</p>
<p>The context updating process updates the context based on information within
the event stream as follows.</p>

<h4>Namespace / Prefix Mappings</h4>

<p>The <code>NamespacePrefixTracker</code> associated with the
<code>XMLPipelineContext</code> is updated as follows.</p>

<ul>
    <li>Upon receipt of a <code>startPrefixMapping</code> event a mapping is added to
it.</li>
    <li>Upon receipt of a <code>endPrefixMapping</code> event a mapping is removed
from it.</li>
</ul>

<p>Currently the above events are not consumed by this process but eventually
they will be so processes should not rely on them, either for the information
they contain or for the fact that they are produced at all.</p>

<h4>Base URI</h4>

<p>The Base URI associated with the <code>XMLPipelineContext</code> is updated
as follows.</p>
<ul>
    <li>It is the responsibility of the creator of the pipeline to provide an
    initial base URI against which subsequent possibly relative base URIs can
    be resolved.</li>

    <li>Upon receipt of a <code>startDocument</code> event the system id of the
    <code>Locator</code> that was passed to the <code>setDocumentLocator</code>
    method is resolved against the current base URI and the result is pushed
    onto the stack of base URIs. In addition the <code>Locator</code> will be
    pushed onto the stack of <code>Locator</code>s. If no <code>Locator</code>
    was provided, or the system id was null then a warning should be logged but
    neither of the stacks will be modified.</li>

    <li>Upon receipt of an <code>endDocument</code> event the current base URI
    and current locator are popped off the stacks as long as they were pushed by
    the matching <code>startDocument</code> event.</li>

    <li>Upon receipt of a <code>startElement</code> event that has an
    <code>xml:base</code> attribute the value of the attribute is resolved
    against the current base URI and then pushed onto the stack.</li>

    <li>Upon receipt of a <code>endElement</code> event the current base URI
    is popped off the stack as long as it was pushed by the matching
    <code>startElement</code> event.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>setDocumentLocator</code>, <code>startDocument</code>, and
<code>endDocument</code> events are all consumed by this process as they are
not allowed within the pipeline.</p>

<h3>Annotating Event Stream</h3>

<p>Standard SAX event consumers, such as XSLT Transformers and serializers as
well as custom written <code>ContentHandler</code>s will not work properly
unless receive the contextual information within the event stream. This is the
responsibility of the context annotating process which will eventually be an
exact mirror of the context updating process.</p>
<p>Context annotating processes can be created using the
{@link com.volantis.xml.pipeline.sax.XMLPipelineFactory#createContextAnnotatingProcess}
method.</p>
<p>The context annotating process adds the following information back into the
stream.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Upon invocation of the <code>startProcess</code> method it will invoke
    <code>setDocumentLocator</code> with a <code>Locator</code> object
    that wraps the <code>XMLPipelineContext</code> and delegates to its current
    <code>Locator</code>, generate a <code>startDocument</code> event and
    finally forward the input event.</li>

    <li>Upon invocation of the <code>stopProcess</code> method it will generate
    a matching <code>endDocument</code> event.</li>

    <li>It will add an xml:base attribute with a value equal to the value of the
    current base URI to the root elements (if we are generating an XML fragment
    there may be many) and also to any element when it detects that the current
    base URI is different to the value of the closest enclosing xml:base
    attribute.</li>
</ul>
