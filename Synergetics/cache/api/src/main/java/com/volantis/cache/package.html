API for general caching infrastructure.

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>This caching infrastructure has the following requirements:</p>

<dl>

<dt>Atomic get and set.</dt>
<dd>A query on the cache that fails to find a matching item will result in an
item being created somehow and being stored in the cache. This whole process
must be atomic so that other threads that attempt to access that item will wait
until the item has been updated.</dd>

<dt>Item level locking.</dt>
<dd>Different items must be able to be queried and updated concurrently so that
they do not cause the whole cache to be locked which would degrade
performance.</dd>

<dt>Grouping.</dt>
<dd>An individual cache defines a single key space within which all keys are
unique but it must also provide a mechanism for grouping information
hierarchically within itself to ease management of a large number of items.</dd>

<dt>Expiration / Validation.</dt>
<dd>Individual items must be able to expire so that they can then be
revalidated against the item source.</dd>

<dt>Removal Notifications.</dt>
<dd>It must be possible for the user of the cache to be notified when items are
removed from the cache. This is useful to invalidate information that was
generated from the now invalid item.</dd>

<dt>Statistics Gathering.</dt>
<dd>Caches must be tuned in order to be effective and the best way to do that
is by providing statistics about how they are performing. Statistics will be
provided on a per group basis.</dd>

<dt>Easy to use.</dt>
<dd>The user of the cache must not be exposed to any of the internal complexity
of the cache, in particular how it is synchronized and whether their code will
cause deadlocks..</dd>

<dt>Robust.</dt>
<dd>The cache must be robust, i.e. it must not deadlock, or allow its internal
structures to be corrupted. The best way of achieving this is through simple
design and rigorous testing.</dd>

<dt>Performant.</dt>
<dd>Although this is not the primary requirement the cache must be as
performant as possible within the constraints set by the other
requirements.</dd>

</dl>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Before it can be used the cache has to be built which is done using the
{@link com.volantis.cache.CacheBuilder CacheBuilder}. The newly built
cache has a root {@link com.volantis.cache.group.Group Group} to which other
groups can be added at any time.</p>

<p>If items in the cache can expire than an
{@link com.volantis.cache.expiration.ExpirationChecker ExpirationChecker} must
be set on the cache builder. It will be invoked every time that an entry is
requested while holding the mutex on the entry and so must be written
accordingly.</p>

<p>If providing an item for the cache does not require any per retrieval
information then a
{@link com.volantis.cache.provider.CacheableObjectProvider provider} can be
set on the builder, otherwise a provider must be supplied on every
retrieval.</p>

<p>The maximum count is the maximum number of entries allowed in the cache. This
must be set to 1 or more. This becomes the maximum count on the root group.</p>

<p>Groups can be added to a group by using a
{@link com.volantis.cache.group.GroupBuilder GroupBuilder}. It must have a max
count of 1 or more. The max count of a group may be larger or smaller than the
sum of the max counts of its child groups. If it is smaller then the available
space will be spread evenly between the group and its children so that no one
group can monopolise the space.</p>

<p>If the user of the cache needs to know when entries are removed from the
cache, e.g. in order to invalidate derived information stored elsewhere then
they can register a
{@link com.volantis.cache.notification.RemovalListener RemovalListener} with
a group and it will be invoked when any entries are removed from that group
and any of its child groups.</p>
