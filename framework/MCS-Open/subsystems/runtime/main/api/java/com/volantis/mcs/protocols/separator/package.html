Provides support for managing separators between pieces of content.

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As their name suggests separators are used within protocols to separate
various pieces of content. This package provides general support for managing
these separators. It may seem a little overkill to provide a whole package for
this purpose but there are many subtleties with separators and how they are used
that makes them much more complex then they appear at first sight. The aim of
this package is to provide an abstract (protocol independent) infrastructure for
representing and managing them. This infrastructure must provide as much control
as possible to the protocols.</p>

<p>The following list contains some of the things that this infrastructure has
to support:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Are separators written out before the first item and after the last
    item, or just between items?</li>

    <li>What happens when two separators are written out one after another, are
    they both rendered, the first, the second, some composite of both, or
    neither?</li>

    <li>Does the content have any effect on whether separators are written out
    or not?</li>
</ul>

<h3>HTML Examples</h3>

<p>The complexity of the interactions can be seen by looking at HTML menus.
HTML uses separators to enforce a particular orientation of the menu. If an
item is rendered as an image then it does not need a horizontal separator but
it does still need a vertical separator. However, if it is rendered as a piece
of text then it needs a horizontal separator between it and the previous item
(if any) and also between it and the next item (if any). As an image can
fallback to text it is not known until the item itself is rendered how it will
eventually be rendered.</p>

<p>HTML also uses separators in order to group menu items. These separators do
interact, i.e. make use of, the orientation separators but the reverse is not
true. These separators can be either a sequence of characters, or an image.
The style properties for a menu item group determine the type of separator as
well as whether it is required before, after or both before and after the items
in the group. This means that currently it is possible for two separators to be
written out together. This looks very nasty and while it is possible to use
styles to prevent this in some cases, such as if the menus are dynamically
generated this may not be possible. In this case a choice needs to be made about
what is written out in place of the two separators.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The package contains the following interfaces.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>{@link SeparatorManager}</dt>
    <dd>This interface is the core of the separator infrastructure, it is
    responsible for managing the state of the separator, invoking renderers and
    asking the arbitrator to choose the appropriate action to take when there
    are conflicts.</dd>

    <dt>{@link SeparatorRenderer}</dt>
    <dd>This interface actually performs the rendering of the separator when
    requested by the {@link SeparatorManager}. They are typically very simple,
    and stateless so that a single instance can be used concurrently.</dd>

    <dt>{@link SeparatorArbitrator}</dt>
    <dd>This interface is responsible for choosing the appropriate action to
    take when there is a (possible) conflict. Implementations should only use
    the information that they are provided to the methods in order to make the
    decision. In particular it should be stateless so that a single instance can
    be used concurrently.</dd>

    <dt>{@link SeparatedContent}</dt>
    <dd>This interface represents a type of content. The
    {@link SeparatorArbitrator} implementation defines the types of
    contents.</dd>
</dl>

<h2>Usages</h2>

<p>The interactions between the above instances are quite complex and are best
explained by the following concrete examples. The examples are targeted mainly
at the {@link SeparatorArbitrator} and any interactions that there are with
the {@link SeparatorRenderer}s and {@link SeparatedContent}.</p>

<h3>General Usage</h3>

<p>The basic procedure for writing out the menu items (content) and separators
is as follows.</p>

<ol>
    <li>Get the manager to begin a new set of items by calling the
    {@link SeparatorManager#begin} method with the separator to use.</li>

    <li>Render the content. The {@link SeparatorManager} is not involved in the
    actual rendering of the content but it will be informed of the type of
    content that will be rendered through its
    {@link SeparatorManager#beforeContent} method in order to decide whether
    the delayed separator (if any) is rendered or ignored.</li>

    <li>Add the next separator to the manager by calling the
    {@link SeparatorManager#separator}.</li>

    <li>Repeat the above two loops until all the content has been
    written.</li>

    <li>Get the manager to end the set of items by calling the
    {@link SeparatorManager#end} method with the separator to use.</li>
</ol>

<h3>HTML Menu Orientation Example</h3>

<p>The following is an example of how the separator infrastructure can be used
to support HTML menu orientation separators.</p>

<p>todo: For consistencies sake this should be updated to match the HTML
implementation. At the moment the description below is simply an example of how
it could be implemented, not a definition of how it should be implemented.</p>

<p>In HTML menu there are two separator types, horizontal and vertical ones,
and two content types, image and text. The arbitrator can use the different
types to decide between the different ways of doing it.</p>

<p>There will be the following HTML specific implementations of the
interfaces.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>HTMLHorizontalSeparator</dt>
    <dd>A {@link SeparatorRenderer} that will render a space (either breaking
    or non breaking depending on the style property).</dd>

    <dt>HTMLVerticalSeparator</dt>
    <dd>A {@link SeparatorRenderer} that will render a line break.</dd>

    <dt>HTMLImageContent</dt>
    <dd>A {@link SeparatedContent} implementation that indicates that the next
    content rendered to the {@link com.volantis.mcs.protocols.OutputBuffer}
    managed by the {@link SeparatorManager} will be an image.</dd>

    <dt>HTMLTextContent</dt>
    <dd>A {@link SeparatedContent} implementation that indicates that the next
    content rendered to the {@link com.volantis.mcs.protocols.OutputBuffer}
    managed by the {@link SeparatorManager} will be some text.</dd>

    <dt>HTMLMenuOrientationSeparatorArbitrator</dt>
    <dd>A {@link SeparatorArbitrator} that will render a horizontal separator
    (HTMLHorizontalSeparator) unless it is preceded and followed by an image
    (HTMLImageContent).</dd>
</dl>

<p>The code that is responsible for rendering out a menu item in HTML will
inform the {@link SeparatorManager} of the type of content that it will render.
The code that is responsible for rendering out the separators will ask the
{@link SeparatorManager} to render them.</p>

<p>In order to achieve the required result the HTML arbitrator has to make the
following decisions.</p>

<dl>
    <dt>betweenSeparators</dt>
    <dd>As far as I know at the moment this method should never be called. If it
    is then it probably indicates an error in the menu rendering code.</dd>

    <dt>beforeContent</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If the content is null then the menu is about to end and we do not
        want a separator after the last menu item so should ignore it.</p>

        <p>If the separator is a horizontal separator and the content is image
        then the separator should be ignored.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, the separator should be used.</p>
    </dd>

    <dt>afterContent</dt>
    <dd>
        <p>If the content is null then it indicates that the menu is about to
        start and we do not want a separator before the first menu item so we
        should ignore it.</p>

        <p>Otherwise, the rendering of the separator should be delayed.</p>
    </dd>
</dl>

<h4>todo: Control separator based on surrounding content</h4>
<p>Currently, we can only control the separator based on the content that
comes before, or after but not both. This limitation makes it impossible to
only ignore the horizontal separator if both pieces of content are images. The
above rules will ignore the horizontal separator only if the content following
is an image.</p>

<p>In order to support this the {@link SeparatorArbitrator} needs to be able
to access additional information from the separator manager. Rather than
extend the parameters to the methods it would be better (more extensible) if
the arbitrator could request that information itself, possibly from the
{@link SeparatorArbitrator.Decision} that is passed in.</p>

<p>Also, by doing this it should be possible to simplify the
{@link SeparatorArbitrator} interface so that it only has two methods, one to
choose between two separators and one to decide on whether to use a separator
between two pieces of content.</p>
