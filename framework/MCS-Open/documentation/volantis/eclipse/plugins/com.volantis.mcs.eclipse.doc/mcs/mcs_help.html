    <p>Volantis Mobility Server 5.1™ is a standards-based development and execution
      environment for delivering mobile content. Multi-Channel Server (MCS), Media Access Proxy
      (MAP) and Message Preparation Server (MPS) are the component parts of VMS.</p>
    
      <h2>Multi-Channel Server</h2>
      <p>Multi-Channel Server helps you manage the complexity of delivering a wide variety of
        content to PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, interactive digital TV, internet appliances, games
        consoles, VoiceXML and interactive kiosks. </p>
      <p>To deliver to multiple channels, you need to present content, services and applications in
        a consistent way across all target devices. In MCS you can separate application design from
        device delivery, and build a cost-effective and scalable system. </p>
    
    
      <h2>Media Access Proxy</h2>
      <p>MAP is a web application that is used to perform transcoding and transformation operations
        on media files referenced by XDIME 2. It comes with an image processing plugin which handles
        many image formats, and can forward requests to Standard Transcoding Interface (STI)
        compliant transcoders. </p>
      <p>When you install MCS there is an option to make server configuration settings for MAP,
        which you can install later. MAP requires a JNDI datasource to be configured, and if you
        require caching of transcoded assets, then you must also install the Squid Internet Object
        Cache server. </p>
      <p>When MCS finds an object element in the XDIME source, the src attribute value is passed to
        the MAP, together with configuration parameters that will determine the transcoded output.
        For example, an image configuration would contain a number of parameters that define the
        result of the operation such as width, height, and image type. A unique identifier
        associated with the parameters is encoded as a URL and returned to MCS. MCS replaces the
        original src attribute value with the new URL, and renders the page. </p>
    
    
      <h2>Message Preparation Server</h2>
      <p>MPS builds on the core functionality of MCS to allow the optimization of message-based or
        WAP push content. It provides the ability to write applications to generate and transmit
        messages to subscribers’ devices. This allows applications to be created that can support
        mass distribution of messages to provide significant end user function. The messages might,
        for example, contain information that users had subscribed to. </p>
