    <p>Multi-Channel Server (MCS) helps you manage the complexity of delivering a wide variety of
      content to PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, interactive digital TV, internet appliances, games
      consoles, VoiceXML and interactive kiosks.</p>
    <p>To deliver to multiple channels, you need to present content, services and applications in a
      consistent way across all target devices. In MCS you can separate application design from
      device delivery, and build a cost-effective and scalable system, by defining policies.</p>
    <p>In MCS you use policies to establish detailed control over visual appearance and behavior.
      This policy design information, which MCS holds in a shared repository, combines templates,
      digital media assets, layouts and stylistic policies for your content.</p>
    
      <h2>Tutorials</h2>
      <p> To get you started there are several tutorials. <em>Getting started</em> is for complete
        beginners, covering how to install the MCS, set up the Eclipse development IDE, and using
        the MCS policy editors and XDIME 2 markup on a simple welcome page. </p>
      <p><em>Next steps with MCS</em> takes you through constructing a more complex mobile site, the
        Jive Sports intranet. Next, you can extend the Jive site by <em>Adding dynamic content</em>
        from HTTP resources. In <em>Using the widget library</em>, you can
        study the declarative XML structures and create compelling interactive pages using AJAX
        methods. The <em>Working with XForms</em> tutorial illustrates the use of XForms. The XForms
        standard defines a device-neutral, platform-independent set of form controls allowing to
        separate the purpose of a form from its presentation. </p>
    
    
      <h2>MCS Help</h2>
      <p>It contains topics on the main sections of the policy interface such as policies,
        components and variants, layouts, themes and devices.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Web Author's Guide</h2>
      <p>The guide includes more advanced topics on policy development and working with XDIME.
        Topics also cover the Client Framework, and content integration from external sources.</p>
    
    
      <h2>XDIME Reference</h2>
      <p>It is a complete set of XML element references for XDIME 2. It also includes a
        client library of widgets, which are specified with declarative markup. These reference
        pages always include code snippets to remind you about the best way to structure your
        content.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Administration</h2>
      <p>MCS requires a minimum of maintenance once it is installed. However, there are a number of
        tasks which you will have to carry out from time to time. For example, you may need to
        perform some tuning by modifying the MCS configuration file, <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span>.</p>
      <p>Policy development in Eclipse is done using an XML repository. For production use it is
        usual to import the policies to a JDBC repository.</p>
      <p>The configuration file employs an extensive XML vocabulary for making settings, and a
        complete element reference is provided. These settings include device and project
        configuration, configuration of policy and stylesheet caches, enabling JSP support and
        debugging features.</p>
