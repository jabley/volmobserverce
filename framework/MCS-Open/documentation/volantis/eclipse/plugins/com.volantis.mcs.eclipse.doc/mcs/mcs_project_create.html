    <p>A project is a set of resources that you define for a particular web application. Resources
      that make up a project could include XML or JSP files, variants, layout, theme, component and
      device policies.</p>
    <p>MCS organizes resources according to project, so you can arrange for multiple projects to
      share the same policy repository.</p>
    <p>In MCS, you use the New Project wizard to add a new project to the Workbench. The wizard
      allows you to define:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A project name and location</li>
      <li>Project settings for a device repository and a source directory</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h2>Naming the project</h2>
      <p>The first page in the wizard allows you to locate and name the project, and the location of
        the project contents.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Choose <span class="command">File</span> | <span class="command">New</span> | <span class="command">MCS Project</span></li>
        <li>Enter a name in the <span class="uicontrol">Project name</span> text box</li>
        <li>To choose a location other than your workspace, uncheck the <span class="uicontrol">Use
          default</span> checkbox, and <span class="command">Browse</span> to select a system folder in
          the <span class="uicontrol">Directory</span> control</li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span>
        </li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Defining project settings</h2>
      <p>On the next page you must enter values for the location of the project device repository,
        name the source directory, and optionally enable collaborative working.</p>
      <p>The device repository can be any one on your system that is appropriate for this project.
        The repository filename extension is always <span class="filepath">.mdpr</span>.</p>
      <p>There can only be one policy source directory for a project, and all your MCS resources
        must be in this folder or one under it. The default path of the source directory is
          <span class="filepath">WebContent/mcs-policies</span>, but you can use any name you wish.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Changing this directory location after you create a project may invalidate
        any existing policies.</div>
      <ol>
        <li>Use the <span class="command">Browse</span> button to locate a <span class="uicontrol">Standard device
            repository file</span></li>
        <li>Enter a name in the <span class="uicontrol">Policy source directory</span> control, or accept
          the default</li>
        <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span></li>
        <li>In the Open Associated Perspective dialog, check <span class="command">Yes</span> to ensure the
          MCS perspective is used to display this project. The new project icon appears in the
          Navigator pane.</li>
        <li>To view the project contents, select the icon and choose <span class="command">File</span> |
            <span class="command">Refresh</span>. Now expand the project.</li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Adding MCS resources to an existing project</h2>
    
    <p>You can add MCS resources to an existing Eclipse project,
      such as a company web site, by adding a folder to your project. This will be your policy
      source directory. You do not have to create an MCS project.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose an existing folder or right click on a project folder and choose
        <span class="command">New</span> | <span class="command">Folder</span>. With a new folder you can use any name,
        but a name like 'MCS policies' will be meaningful.</li>
      <li>Now choose a policy wizard for the resource you want to add</li>
      <li>On the MCS settings page in the wizard click <span class="command">Browse</span> to locate a device
        repository for the project</li>
      <li>Continue with the wizard to complete adding the resource</li>
    </ol>
    <p>MCS displays the resource icon in the new folder, and opens an editor on the resource.</p>
