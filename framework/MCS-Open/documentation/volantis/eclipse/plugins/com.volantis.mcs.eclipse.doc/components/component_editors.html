    <p>There is a component editor for each component type. There are some differences related to
      the component type, but they share several features.</p>
    <p>All the editors have controls grouped in the following sections.</p>
    
      <h2>Component attributes</h2>
      <p>Each editor contains a section defining the attributes of the component. You can use the
          <span class="uicontrol">Device category scheme</span> control to associate an existing device
        category scheme or a custom scheme with the policy. For more information on using a custom
        scheme, refer to <em>Custom device policies</em>.</p>
      <p>In some editors additional attribute values are fallback component names to which the
        current component refers. In other cases such as rollover image components, they are
        references to the actual image components used. In all cases you can
        <span class="command">Browse</span> to locate the component to refer to.</p>

    
    
      <h2>Variants</h2>
      <p>Any variants that you have added to a component are listed in the Variants section. You can
        add and remove variants at any time. Some components support multiple variants, while
        others allow only a single variant reference.</p>
      <p>Common to all Variants sections are buttons to <span class="command">Add</span> or
        <span class="command">Delete</span> variants, and a variants list. The Variant section for an image
        component also has a <span class="command">New</span> button. When you add image variants, you can
        browse to a directory and filter for a file type, and in some cases see a preview of the
        image. MCS also obtains some image variant attributes from the file system.</p>
      <p>Variant icons in the list are like the icons in the policy tree, with a blue lozenge
        decoration. When you select an variant in the list, the Selection Criteria, Content and
        Metadata sections of the editor are enabled, and you can edit the attribute values. You can
        also choose multiple variants, and apply values that are common to those variants to all
        items in the selection.</p>

    
    
      <h2>Variant Selection Criteria</h2>
      <p>You use this section to define which variant is selected for use on a particular device. If
        the variant is targeted, you can choose a combination of targets from the device tree and a
        single set of devices in a custom category scheme.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Variant Content</h2>
      <p>All variants have a <span class="uicontrol">URL</span> control, which is most often the filename of
        the variant. Script and text variants additionally can be entered directly in the content
        section as an alternative to using a file resource.</p>
      <p>In this section you can also add a reference to a asset group, and also specify a null
        variant</p>
    
    
      <h2>Variant Metadata</h2>
      <p>Metadata is information about the policy variant that is used by MCS to determine how to
        use the variant when it has been selected.</p>
      <p>In this section you can set values such as MIME type, rendering, height and width values,
        the available controls depending on the component type you are working with.</p>
