      <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
      <p>This tutorial follows on from <em>Next Steps with MCS</em>, and assumes that you
        have worked through those examples, especially those on XDIME 2. So, if you have not done so
        already, please read it before you continue. It reuses policies and assets located in the
          <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps/mcs/tutorial/</span> directory.</p>
      <p>It will also be helpful if you have some knowledge or experience of XSL transformations,
      because we will not go into detail about their structure and use.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The examples described in this tutorial can be found in the
        <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps/mcs/tutorial/</span> directory.</div>
    
    
      <h2>Required software</h2>
      <p>Before you start make sure you have MCS installed on your computer.
        Refer to the installation documentation.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Jive portal</h2>
      <p>By now you should be quite familiar with the Jive site. Policies are available for a PC and
        Smartphone versions of many site pages. However, as our focus is on integrating external
        content, we will work with PC layouts and themes. The emphasis here is on processing
        external resources. We do not discuss layouts, themes and other policies, assuming that you
        already understand the concepts and related tasks.</p>
