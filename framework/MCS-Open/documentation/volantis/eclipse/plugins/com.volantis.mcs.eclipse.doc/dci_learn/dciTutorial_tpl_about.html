    <p>MCS allows to develop XDIME templates that authors can use to separate XML datasources from
      the web pages that consume them. For example, the web pages within the same web application
      may have similar structure, i.e. they may consists of header, body and footer sections. The
      header and footer content usually remains the same for all the pages. It's the body of a page
      that changes. Some page specific details, such as title, may change as well. It is possible to
      define those common elements in a single file, called template, and then reference such file
      from several pages, containing custom content. This approach allows, for instance, easily and
      quickly change the structure of the page by modifying the template only.</p>
    <p>To illustrate the use of XDIME templates we will recreate the Jive welcome page. Its
      structure will be defined by a template, containing some common elements, such as, logo,
      navigation bar, etc. The page specific details, for example, page title and its content will
      be passed from another file.</p>
