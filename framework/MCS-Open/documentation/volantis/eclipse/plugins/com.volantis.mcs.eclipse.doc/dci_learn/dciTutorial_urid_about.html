    <p>An XDIME page may include resources from the local file system. For example, a page header
      can be saved as a separate file. Then, several XDIME pages may reference that file, and fetch
      the header with the rest of the page at runtime. Keeping common content in a separate place
      reduces maintenance costs. Moreover, an XSL transform can be used to convert the information
      to XDIME during fetching. This allows authors to gather almost any kind of structured data
      from a variety of sources on a single XDIME page.</p>
    <p>The <span class="code">urid:fetch</span> element is intended to include resources from the local
      file system, though it may be used for remote resources. Generally, however, the
        <span class="code">webd:get</span> element should be used to retrieve content from a web server.
      Refer to <em>Accessing HTTP resources</em> for further information. </p>
    <p>We will now rework the Human Resources page you created in <em>Getting Started with MCS</em>.
      The page header and the footer will be held in separate files. The
      <span class="code">urid:fetch</span> element will be used to add them to the main page at runtime.</p>
