      <h2>Configuration files</h2>
      <p>The <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> configuration file defines system parameters for
        MCS. The file is found in the
        <span class="filepath">[path]/MCS/webapps/[context_root]/WEB-INF/</span> directory. The installation
        process will have set the basic parameters and you should have no need to change these until
        you have become more experienced in the use of MCS. A description of
          <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> and how to use it can be found in <em>Configuring MCS</em> in the Administering MCS section of Help.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Support JARs</h2>
      <p>Support JARs are shipped with MCS. These should only be used when instructed by as they are
        for debugging support purposes. If used they will output debug logging information that will
        have a detrimental effect on the performance of MCS.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Setting up the XML Parser</h2>
      <p>MCS uses the Xerces parser by default. If you wish to use this XML parser you need do
        nothing further. If you decide to use any other XML parser you must use the system property
        org.xml.sax.driver to specify the location of the SAXParserFactory class.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Setting up the policy editors</h2>
      <p>After you have installed MCS, you need to set up the plugins for the policy editors in the
          Eclipse framework.</p>
      <p>You should copy the contents <span class="filepath">/MCS/eclipse/plugins</span> directory, including
        any sub-directories, to the plugins directory location, for example
          <span class="filepath">/opt/eclipse/plugins/</span>. You should also copy the contents of
          <span class="filepath">/MCS/eclipse/features/</span> to the features location, for example
          <span class="filepath">/opt/eclipse/features/</span>.</p>
      <p>When you launch Eclipse, these will be available as a set
        of wizards and editors for creation and manipulation of MCS objects.</p>
    
    
    
      <h2>Setting up the Media Access Proxy (MAP)</h2>
      <p>If you installed MAP, you can learn about its features and configuration in <em>Media Access Proxy</em> in the MAP section of Eclipse
      Help.</p>
