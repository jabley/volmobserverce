    <p>Installing and configuring Multi-Channel Server (MCS) involves a number of steps, outlined
    here, and detailed in related topics.</p>
    <p>Media Access Proxy and Message Preparation Server are optional installations. MAP is required
      if you wish to transcode media to match device characteristics. MPS is required if you wish to
      use push messaging with MCS.</p>
    <p>Volantis Mobility Server includes the <em>Getting Started</em> guide, which
      contains instructions for compiling the open source code, and quickly installing a working
      development system with Eclipse and Tomcat. <em>Getting Started</em> is available in both XHTML and PDF
      formats on the community documentation site.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you have an existing MCS repository, you should ensure that it is fully
      backed up prior to any maintenance work.</div>
    
      <h2>Required software</h2>
      <p>MCS operates as an application within a web application server. The web application server
        you choose must be installed and working successfully before MCS can be used.</p>
      <p>At design time, you define policies for devices, layouts, components and themes in an XML
        repository. The policy editors operate within the Eclipse
        Framework as a set of integrated plugins. The Eclipse
        Framework needs to be downloaded and installed before the policy editors can be used.</p>
      <p>At runtime, the XML policy repository may also be deployed as a set of tables within a SQL
        database. If you wish to use a database as a repository you should have the client installed
        and working before you install MCS.</p>
    
    
    
      <h2>Running the installer</h2>
      <p>The installation wizard steps you through a series of pages containing settings that
        correspond to the entries in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Setting up your runtime repository</h2>
      <p>The MCS installation will create a <span class="filepath">devices.mdpr</span> file that contains the
        MCS device repository information. You can access the repository with the Device Repository
        editor. Additionally, individual XML files are created as policies, and are constructed and
        modified in a default project.</p>
      <p>If the policy repository needs to be deployed within a SQL database at runtime; appropriate
        users and tables will need to be created in the database management system, and any required
        XML policies will need to be imported into the database.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Completing the setup</h2>
      <p>The MCS configuration file is used to control the operation of MCS. However, the initial
        settings created by the installation process will normally be adequate.</p>
      <p>This section deals with any other tasks required.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Installing MAP</h2>
      <p>MCS relies on the Media Access Proxy (MAP) which also incorporates the ICS servlet for URL
        and STI transcoding services. MAP has a separate installer. When you have completed your MCS
        installation, you should install and configure MAP and ICS.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Verifying the MCS installation</h2>
      <p>Finally, you will want to be reassured that everything works. A sample 'welcome' JSP page
        is available to test your MCS installation.</p>
    
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Because file locations are set during installation, the configuration examples
      shown in related topics use placeholders for parts of the directory structure. You should
      substitute <span class="filepath">[path]</span> with the path preceding the location described, and
        <span class="filepath">[context_root]</span> with the application root context.</div>
