    <p>In MCS you can design themes that will provide an overall look and feel to your web site.
      Each theme can have variants that you define for individual devices or groups of devices.</p>
    <p>Each variant is made up of a set of style rules, and each rule is identified by a selector,
      and has a set of properties.</p>
    <p>While you use layouts to specify the physical position of elements on pages, you employ style
      rules for values such as, fonts, colors, backgrounds and borders.</p>
    <p>Styles are device-dependent because devices differ greatly in the support available for this
      kind of information. So MCS has to identify the requesting device before applying a set of
      rules.</p>
    <p>You use the Theme wizard or the Theme editor to associate variants with devices, and the
      editor to define selectors and properties. You can also use the Style Rules view to get an
      overall picture of the themes for a particular theme variant, and perform some limited editing
      actions.</p>
