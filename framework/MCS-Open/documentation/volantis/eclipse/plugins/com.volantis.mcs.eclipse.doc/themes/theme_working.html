    <p>You can define theme policies for individual devices and groups of devices. A theme is made
      up of a set of style rules, and each rule is identified by a selector, and has a set of
      properties.</p>
    <p>You can also build up complex themes, which share core branding styles specified at a higher
      level and adjust these at a device family or specific device level.</p>
    <p class="taskhead">To develop a theme in MCS:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Add a theme</strong> policy to your project using the New Theme wizard</li>
      <li>Using the Theme editor, <strong>choose a device</strong> or devices to associate with your theme</li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add selectors</strong> to the theme and assign <strong>style properties</strong> to them</li>
    </ol>
