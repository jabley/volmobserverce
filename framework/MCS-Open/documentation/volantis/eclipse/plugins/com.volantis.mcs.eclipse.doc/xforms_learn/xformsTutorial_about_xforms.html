    <p>XDIME 2 provides developers with a simple, standards-compliant authoring environment. The
      XDIME 2 vocabulary is easy to learn and use. It relies on key web authoring specifications,
      and the way in which these standards are combined and used is based on work currently under
      way in the W3C Device Independence Working group.</p>
    <p>XDIME 2 makes use of elements from the XForms vocabulary, but not all XForms elements and
      attributes are included. The XForms standard defines a device-neutral, platform-independent
      set of form controls allowing to separate the purpose of a form from its presentation. If you
      are not familiar with the W3C XForms Version 1.0 recommendation, you may want to review it
      before you develop any XDIME 2 content.</p>
