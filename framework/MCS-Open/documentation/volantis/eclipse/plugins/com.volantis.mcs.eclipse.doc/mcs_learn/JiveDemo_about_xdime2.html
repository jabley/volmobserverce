    <p>XDIME 2 provides developers with a simple, standards-compliant authoring environment. The
      XDIME 2 vocabulary is easy to learn and use. It relies on key web authoring specifications,
      and the way in which these standards are combined and used is based on work currently under
      way in the W3C Device Independence Working group.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>XHTML Version 2</li>
      <li>CSS Version 2.1 enhanced with some features of the forthcoming CSS Version 3</li>
      <li>XForms Version 1.0</li>
      <li>DISelect Version 1.0</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If you are not familiar with these recommendations, you may want to review them before you
      develop any XDIME 2 content.</p>
    <p>An XDIME 2 page has a well defined structure. Like any XML document, it starts with
      declaration of vocabulary namespaces used. The <span class="code">head</span> element contains
      definition of the MCS layout and theme policies. The content of the page is defined in its
        <span class="code">body</span> element.</p>
    <p>The use of XDIME 2 markup is discussed in the second part of this tutorial.</p>
