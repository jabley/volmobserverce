    <p>MCS manages the relationship between device-independent content and device-dependent data by
      using components and variants. For example, an image component can refer to a set of image
      files, or variants, that individually fit the profiles of several different devices. The
      attributes of each variant are contained in the component. In a web page, the 
      <span class="code">img</span> element in the XDIME markup contains the name of the Image component
      in it's <span class="code">src</span> attribute. When a device requests the page, MCS uses the
      image attributes to select the best image variant to display on the device.</p>
    <p>Layouts contain the device dependent positioning for information rendered on a variety of
      displays, where limitations of small devices may require that content be split or even
      omitted.</p>
    <p>Themes govern the style of a site across multiple devices. The thematic information for a
      device is termed a style, and a style contains rules that are appropriate to the delivery
      context.</p>
    <p>First part of this tutorial explains how to create image components, layouts, and theme
      policies.</p>
