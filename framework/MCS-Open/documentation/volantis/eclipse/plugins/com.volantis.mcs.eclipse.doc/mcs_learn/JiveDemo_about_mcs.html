    <p>Volantis Multi-Channel Server (MCS) helps you to deliver to multiple channels, presenting
      content services and applications in a consistent way across all target devices. In MCS you
      can separate application design from device delivery, and build a cost-effective and scalable
      system, by defining policies.</p>
    <p>Policies describe the individual pieces of information that MCS needs to render pages that
      match the devices used by a range of users. By applying different policies, you can
      distinguish between 'device-specific' and 'device-independent' information. This policy based
      separation enables quicker, easier maintenance as well as rapid implementation.</p>
    <p>The first part of this tutorial will guide you through the process of creating component
      policies, layouts, and themes. You can target visual presentation elements such as page
      layouts and style sheets at particular devices, and reuse them easily. You can administer a
      single source, rather than having to programatically generate a piece of logic for each and
      every device, layout or mark-up combination.</p>
    <p>The second part of the tutorial will introduce you to XDIME 2 markup (XML Device Independent
      Markup Extensions). XDIME 2 is a standards based XML vocabulary, using familiar elements from
      XHTML and XForms, though the exact syntax and attributes may not be identical. This makes it
      very easy to create XDIME content if you already know these languages.</p>
