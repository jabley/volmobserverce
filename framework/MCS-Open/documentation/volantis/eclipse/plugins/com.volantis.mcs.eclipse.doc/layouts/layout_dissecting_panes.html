    <p>You can use dissecting panes to ensure that the devices like mobile phones can deal with
      fragments in a layout. You can include only one dissecting pane per fragment.</p>
    
      <h2>Shards</h2>
      <p>MCS automatically splits up the content of a dissecting pane, and sends it as one or more
        shards to a device. For devices for which there is no maximum WML deck size, the entire
        content of the dissecting pane is sent in a single shard. Essentially, the dissecting pane
        behaves exactly like a normal pane.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Navigation links</h2>
      <p>MCS also generates navigation links automatically, so users can move between the shards. If
        a shard is the first shard, the link to the next shard is enabled. If a shard is the last
        shard, the link to the previous shard is enabled. For all other shards, both links are
        enabled. You can associate links with device access keys, where protocols permit it.</p>
