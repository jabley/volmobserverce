    <p>In a montage layout you can use segments or frames to position the output from multiple
      canvasses on a device. You should use montage layouts for large-screen devices, ideally for
      those that support frames. </p>
    <p>The figure shows how a simple montage layout appears in the Layout editor's Design page. The
      grid format consists of three rows, each of which contains a segment. The top row displays a
      title and images for the web site, The middle row holds a site menu. The bottom row contains
      canvasses selected in the menu segment.</p>
    <p><img src="../graphics/layout_montage.png" alt="A montage layout with segments" title="A montage layout with segments"/></p>
    <p> As in all layouts, each segment must have a unique name that you use to specify where output
      from the canvasses appears.</p>
    <p>Each segment has attributes associated with it. These attributes can affect the formatting
      that is applied as the page is generated. Frame and segment attributes set values for frame
      margins, determine whether you can resize a frame or scroll its content, and so on. </p>
