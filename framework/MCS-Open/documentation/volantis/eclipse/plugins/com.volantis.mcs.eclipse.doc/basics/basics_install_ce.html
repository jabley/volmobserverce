Volantis Mobility Server requires a
      web application server, JDK 1.5 or 1.6, and the Eclipse IDE is needed for policy development.
      See <em>MCS Supported platforms</em> for further information. You will also find an
      XML editor useful for creating XDIME code.</p><p>If you plan to download the source code, you will also need Maven to build the Community
      edition.</p><ol><li>Download and install a copy of the Apache <strong>Tomcat</strong> web application server, if you
      don't already have it. The latest, stable release should be fine. The instructions in this
      guide are based on Tomcat Version 5, which you can find at
        <pre class="code">http://tomcat.apache.org/</pre></li><li>Download and install the Eclipse IDE, if you don't already have it. Version 3.2.2 is a
      good choice. Later versions are not compatible with Volantis Mobility Server. You can find
      downloads of several versions of Eclipse at
        <pre class="code">http://archive.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/index.php</pre></li></ol><h2>Building Volantis Mobility Server</h2><p>To build the Community edition you will need to download five distinct
      <span class="filepath">.tar</span> or <span class="filepath">.zip</span> files (both are available). Because of
      dependencies, you should always build them in the following sequence in cases where you wish
      to build Volantis Mobility Server in its entirety.</p><p>This is because the build process will initially retrieve the required
      <span class="filepath">.jar</span> files from a Volantis server. Once any component is built the JARs
      will be located in your local Maven repository. If you make changes to the source you may not
      want the original JARS to be reused in all cases.</p><ul>
      <li>Synergetics - Synergetics-5.1-ce-src.tgz/zip</li>
      <li>Device Repository - DeviceRepository-5.1-ce-src.tgz/zip</li>
      <li>Media Access Proxy - MAP-5.1-ce-src.tgz/zip</li>
      <li>Multi-Channel Server - MCS-5.1-ce-src.tgz/zip</li>
      <li>Message Preparation Server - MPS-5.1-ce-src.tgz/zip</li>
    </ul><p class="note"><strong>Caution</strong>: Some JARs for application server installations and MPS cannot be
      distributed under the Community edition license. You will need to obtain the JARs from the
      appropriate vendor. To add these to the build, you add system properties with an option to the
      install command, for example <span class="code"> mvn install -Dmcs-dynamo=true mvn install
        -Dmcs-weblogic=true mvn install -Dmcs-nokia=true </span>
    </p><ol><li>If you have not done so already, download the Community edition sources from the following
      URL and unzip them to a directory
      <pre class="code">http://www.volantis.com/sources-download</pre>
    </li><li>Download Maven and install it following the instructions on the Maven site. Version 2.0.8,
      which is in use at Volantis, can be obtained at
        <pre class="code">http://maven.apache.org/download.html</pre>
    </li><li>Ensure that MAVEN_HOME is set to the Maven download location, and JAVA_HOME is set to your
      JDK installation directory</li><li>On Unix <pre class="code">export MAVEN_OPTS="-Xmx256M -XX:MaxPermSize=96M"</pre></li><li>Or on Windows <pre class="code">set MAVEN_OPTS=Xmx256M -XX:MaxPermSize=96M</pre></li><li>Change directory to the MCS source code root directory, and unset your CLASSPATH variable
      if it's set</li><li>Ensure that version 2.0.8 of Maven is used. On Unix add <span class="code">$MAVEN HOME/bin</span> to
      the beginning of your PATH variable. On Windows add <span class="code">%MAVEN HOME%\bin</span> to the PATH
      variable</li><li>If you are not on Linux, build the source with the command <pre class="code">mvn -DskipTests
        install</pre></li><li>To generate the Javadoc (MCS only), change directory to <span class="filepath">javadoc</span> and
      issue the command <pre class="code">mvn javadoc:javadoc</pre></li><li>Optionally build the installers (MCS, MAP and MPS) by changing directory to
        <span class="filepath">installer/api</span> (MCS and MPS) or just <span class="filepath">installer</span> (for
      MAP) and issuing the command <pre class="code">mvn izpack:izpack</pre></li></ol><h2>Running the installer <a href="../install/mcs_install_config.html"><img src="../icons/icon_help.png" border="0" alt="Learn More"/></a></h2><p>Your project information and the device database can be deployed either as XML files or in a
      JDBC repository. We recommend that you configure an XML repository initially, and always use
      it for policy development. When you move to a production system, you can make any necessary
      configuration changes for a suitable environment, and import the policies and device data to a
      JDBC based service. Refer to the administration topics <em>Setting up the MCS runtime</em>, <em>Configuring a JNDI datasource</em> and <em>Importing and exporting repositories</em> for more information.</p><p>To follow this guide you need only install MCS. Later, if you want to use media transcoding
      features, you will also need to install Media Access Proxy (MAP). See <em>Installing MAP</em> in Eclipse Help or the <em>MAP Installation and Administration Guide</em> for
      details. When you install MCS, you can enter the MAP host and port settings if you wish.</p><ol><li>Download the binary installer from the community edition web site 
      (<span class="filepath">http://www.volantis.com/downloads</span>), or use the one you have
      built. A wizard guides you through the installation process.</li><li>Start the installer with the command <pre class="code">
java -jar mcs_installer-5.1jar</pre></li><li>Accept the license agreement</li><li>Accept the default pack selection</li><li>Select 'XML' as a value in the dropdown for <span class="uicontrol">Initial repository
      vendor</span></li><li>On the application server page, select Apache Tomcat from the drop down list. Leave the
        <span class="uicontrol">Host</span> as localhost, but change the port number if you run Tomcat on a
      different port.</li><li>Accept the default Media Access Proxy <span class="uicontrol">URL</span></li><li>Enter the file location to install MCS or accept the default</li><li>The installer displays a summary of some installation choices. Use the
      <span class="command">Previous</span> button to go back and change any options. When you are satisfied
      with all your choices, click <span class="command">Next</span> to start the installation.</li><li>Optionally save your installation settings by clicking <span class="command">Generate an automatic
        installation script</span>, and naming the file. To repeat the installation run the
      following command. <pre class="code">
java -jar mcs_installer-5.1.jar [configuration_file]</pre></li><li>Click <span class="command">Done</span> to complete the installation</li></ol><h2>Copy the Eclipse plugins</h2><p>Volantis Mobility Server includes a number of Eclipse plugins for tools and documentation.
      These need to be copied from the installation to the Eclipse environment as follows.</p><p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: Once you have installed the Eclipse plugins, you will also be able to access
      the documentation in the Eclipse Help system.</p><ol><li>Copy the contents of the <span class="filepath">/MCS/eclipse/plugins</span> directory, including
      any sub-directories, to the Eclipse <span class="filepath">plugins</span> directory location</li><li>Also copy the contents of <span class="filepath">/MCS/eclipse/features/</span> to the
        <span class="filepath">features</span> directory</li><li>An alternative way to install the plugins to Eclipse is to use Eclipse manager: <ol>
        <li>Open Eclipse</li>
        <li>Go to <span class="command">Help</span> | <span class="command">Software Updates</span> | <span class="command">Find and
            Install</span> to open the wizard window</li>
        <li>Select <span class="command">Search for new features to install</span></li>
        <li>Press the <span class="command">New Local Site</span> button and select the
          <span class="filepath">/MCS/eclipse</span> directory</li>
        <li>Press the <span class="command">Finish</span> button</li>
        <li>Accept the terms in the license agreement</li>
        <li>Press <span class="command">Next</span>, and then <span class="command">Finish</span> to complete</li>
      </ol>
    </li></ol><h2>Setting up Tomcat</h2><p>Below the <span class="filepath">webapps</span> directory of your installation, you'll find a
      directory called <span class="filepath">mcs</span>. When you have completed this task, you can check
      that everything has installed correctly by displaying the welcome page.</p><div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The welcome directory contains some additional welcome page materials which
      support more advance XDIME methods. You can examine these at a later time.</div><ol><li>Copy this directory and its contents to the <span class="filepath">webapps</span> directory in your
      Tomcat installation.</li><li>Start Tomcat and point your PC browser at
        <pre class="code">http://localhost:8080/mcs/projects/welcome/simple_welcome.xdime</pre> You
      should see the following page. <p><img src="../graphics/basics/mcs_welcome_pc_ui.png" alt="PC welcome page" title="PC welcome page"/></p>
