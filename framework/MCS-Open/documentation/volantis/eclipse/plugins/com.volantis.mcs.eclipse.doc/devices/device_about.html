    <p> MCS comes with a built-in repository that contains a large number of devices from desktop
      PCs to TVs, PDAs and mobile phones. The range of devices in your repository will depend on the
      specific repository that you have installed.</p>
    <p>A device repository consists of a compressed XML file containing attributes of the devices.
      You can have multiple device repositories on your system, and you can choose one to suit the
      requirements of your project. The repository files have a <span class="filepath">.mdpr</span> extension.</p>
    <p>When you create a new web project, you need to associate the project with a single device
      repository, so you can create layout variants and theme variants for the project. This
      repository can be anywhere on your system.</p>
    <p>You can view the attributes for devices in the repository using a workbench Device Repository
      view. You can also make changes to policy values and identification patterns using the Device
      Repository editor.</p>
    
      <h2>Fallback</h2>
      <p>Each set of device policies has a parent set. If a policy does not exist for the child
        entry, the parent entry is searched and the fallback value is used. Fallback is recursive,
        so that policies may be inherited across a number of 'generations'.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Custom device policies</h2>
      <p> In addition to the device policies that are built in to MCS, you can add custom policies
        in a special Custom category. You may have your own requirements for the way certain devices
        or groups of devices are handled. </p>
      <p>These changes, together with any changes you have made to policy values or identification
        patterns, are kept in a custom section of the repository.</p>
      <p>In component, layout and theme editors you can choose a set of custom policies designed to
        target a variant or variants at specific devices.</p>
