    <p>On the Overview page of the Device Repository editor you can define one or more primary and
      secondary identification patterns for a device.</p>
    <p>MCS uses the identification patterns at runtime to identify an unknown device. The patterns
      are regular expressions that are matched against the device headers. They can be split into
      two sets; those that match user agent headers and those that match general headers.</p>
    <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Patterns must be unique within a repository.</div>
    
      <h2>Primary patterns</h2>

    <p>MCS uses user agent headers in the first identification step.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Choose a device from the Devices tree.</li>
      <li>In the Primary Patterns section click <span class="command">Add</span>. A new item is added to the
        pattern list.</li>
      <li>Enter a regular expression that will be used to match the user agent header.</li>
    </ol>
      
    
      <h2>Secondary patterns</h2>
    
    <p>The device that MCS finds using the primary patterns may indicate that there is a more
      specific device to use, in which case MCS uses the secondary patterns to match the general
      header. The patterns here are made up of three parts; an HTTP header name, an HTTP header
      value and a Base device name.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>In the Secondary Patterns section click <span class="command">Add</span>.</li>
      <li>Enter values for <span class="uicontrol">Header name</span>, <span class="uicontrol">Value</span> and
          <span class="uicontrol">Device name</span>.</li>
      <li>Use the <span class="command">Up</span> and <span class="command">Down</span> buttons to order the patterns in
        the list</li>
    </ol>
    <p>To remove a pattern in either list, select it and click <span class="command">Remove</span>.</p>
    <p>To revert to the standard repository patterns for the device click <span class="command">Restore
    Defaults</span>.</p>
