    <p>The update notification service informs the user that there is a new version of VMS available
      for download. It also allows Volantis to track VMS installations. The update notification
      service client is built into VMS Community Edition, VMS Professional Edition and VMS Database
      Edition.</p>
    <p>Each time you start MCS, the client makes an HTTP request to the Volantis server. The request
      contains its version number. The '200 OK' response means that there is a new version of VMS
      available. The '404 Not Found' response means that the VMS being used is up-to-date. This
      information is added to the log file with the <span class="code">INFO</span> level.</p>
