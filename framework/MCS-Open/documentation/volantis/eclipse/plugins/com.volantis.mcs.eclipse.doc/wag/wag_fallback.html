    <p>MCS supports fallback in applying policies and in locating variants that best match device
      capabilities.</p>
    
      <h2>Policy fallback</h2>
      <p>The fallback mechanism in MCS allows you to add policy information at the most convenient
        point in the device hierarchy. You can share policies across devices, without limiting your
        ability to specify values for particular cases.</p>
      <p>MCS searches up the tree from child to parent, until it finds a suitable policy, right up
        to the root, or Master, device.</p>
      <p>For example, suppose that MCS needs to work out which styles to apply to a heading on a
        page for a PocketPC with Pocket Internet Explorer. First, it looks for a theme policy for
        PocketPC-PIE and uses the policy if there is one. However, if there is no entry, the
        fallback is queried. In this case it is the parent entry for the PocketPC. If there is no
        specific entry here, QVGA Tablet is queried next, and so on up the device tree.</p>

      <h2>Locating variants</h2>
      <p>Fallback also applies when MCS searches for variants in alternative components if a match
        with a device is not found in a component you refer to in XDIME.</p>
      <p>MCS attempts to locate variants in the following order where there is a variant defined for
        a component.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Locate a <strong>null</strong> variant or a <strong>targeted</strong> variant for the device</li>
        <li>Convert a <strong>convertible</strong> image variant using the Media Access Proxy (MAP)</li>
        <li>Use a <strong>generic variant</strong>
        </li>
        <li>Follow the <strong>fallback</strong> rules for the component</li>
      </ol>
