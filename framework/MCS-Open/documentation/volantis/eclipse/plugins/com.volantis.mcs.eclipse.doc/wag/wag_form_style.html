    <p>You can use the Theme editor to apply styles to forms. Apart from more general properties
      that you can use for styling, MCS provides some form-specific properties. Some properties
      apply to the form as a whole; others apply to individual controls on the form.</p>
    <p>The properties allow you to specify how action type and list type input controls are
      displayed, and the names of the image components to be used when an action element has an
      image. You can define the size and row count of text input controls, and style selection
      lists.</p>
    
      <h2>Form fragment link styles</h2>
      <p>If your form is designed to use fragments, you can style the text on links between
        fragments. First you set up a class style, for example a font and a color. Then, in the form
        fragment layout Attribute view, you can assign the style using the
        <span class="uicontrol">Styleclass</span> control for the next and previous <span class="uicontrol">Link
        Text</span>.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Selection styles</h2>
      <p>The <span class="uicontrol">Selection List Style</span> options for 'default', 'controls',
        'circular-list', and 'menu' allow you to define display properties for selection elements in
        your form. A value of 'default' results in the device default behavior.</p>
      <p>When you specify 'controls', the controls will behave either like radio buttons, or
        checkboxes depending on whether the selection list allows only a single value, or multiple
        values to be selected at once. So for a single select element, each of the options on the
        screen is rendered as radio button.</p>
      <p>Defining the 'circular-list' on a single element renders a single option at a time. If the
        browser supports it, the user can navigate up or down through a list, presented as a
        continuous loop, equivalent to the Openwave 'spin' style. If the selection list is a
        multiple select list then the selection list is displayed in the default way for the device
        as if 'default' had been used.</p>
      <p>When a 'menu' style is specified on either type of element, a popup menu is is displayed if
        the device supports it.</p>
