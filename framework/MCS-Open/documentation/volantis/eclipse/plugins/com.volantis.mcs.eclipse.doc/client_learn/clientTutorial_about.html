    <p>The Client Framework is a platform that can be used to create XDIME 2 applications with a
      rich client-side user interface, for a wide range of devices. The Client Framework consists of
      two parts. On the server side, you use a combination of XDIME 2 markup and policy values to
      access the widget functions. In addition, you can include JavaScript in your markup to invoke
      functions from the client library. On the client side, a widget library consists of JavaScript
      that implements those functions.</p>
    <p>If the device does not support the Framework Client, the server-side processing of the XDIME
      2 widget provides an static rendering that assures the basic widget functions.</p>
    
      <h2>Dynamic behavior</h2>
      <p>Many Client Framework widgets are active, in that they are able to load or refresh their
        content or status. These actions are implemented using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
        (AJAX). In order to demonstrate the AJAX capabilities of widgets, MCS includes sample AJAX
        services.</p>
    
    
      <h2>JavaScript and APE</h2>
      <p>Many of the widgets provide a JavaScript API to allow them to be used from other scripts.
        However, the actions, properties and events (APE) architecture allows you to define simple
        interactions between widgets on an XDIME 2 page, without the need to use JavaScript
      methods.</p>
    
    
      <h2>About this tutorial</h2>
      <p>This tutorial describes all the necessary steps to recreate the Client Framework sample
        application, which is part of the Multi-Channel Server (MCS) installation. The policy, XDIME
        and asset files are located in the <span class="filepath">MCS/webapps/mcs/projects/client-app/</span>
        directory. The sample application has a home page with links to sub pages for AJAX and
        non-AJAX widgets, and a page demonstrating the transition effects. </p>
      <p>The first part of the tutorial will guide you through the process of creating the necessary
        component policies, layouts, and themes for the application. The second part of the tutorial
        reviews some basic aspects of XDIME 2 markup and content integration markup, before moving
        on to the specifics of the widget library.</p>
      <p>You should read the documentation on the Client Framework in the <em>Web author's
        guide</em> for background information, and review some of the characteristic of the widget
        library.</p>
      <p>We assume that you are already familiar with MCS concepts and XDIME 2 authoring. If you
        have not already done so, please refer to the tutorials <em>Next steps with MCS</em> and
          <em>Adding dynamic content</em>.</p>
