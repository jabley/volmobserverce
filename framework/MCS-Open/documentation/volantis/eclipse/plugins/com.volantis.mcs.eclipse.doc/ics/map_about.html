    <p>The Media Access Proxy (MAP) is a web application that is used to perform internal
      transcoding and transformation operations on image files, and on other media types externally
      using an STI transcoder service. The resources to be processed are referenced in XDIME 2 with
      the <span class="code">object</span> element. MAP also handles XDIME content and ICS URLs in a
      backward compatible manner.</p>
    <p>The MAP application has four principal components.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Media agent</li>
      <li>Descriptor store</li>
      <li>Operation engine</li>
      <li>ICS servlet</li>
    </ul>
    
      <h2>Media agent</h2>
      <p>When MCS finds an <span class="code">object</span> element in the XDIME source, the
        <span class="code">src</span> attribute value is passed to the media agent, together with
        configuration parameters that will affect the transcoded output. For example, an image
        configuration would contain a number of parameters that define the result of the operation
        such as width, height, and image type.</p>
      <p>The media agent requests the unique identifier associated with the parameters from the
        descriptor store, encodes it as a MAP URL and returns the URL to MCS. MCS replaces the
        original <span class="code">src</span> attribute value with the new URL, and renders the page.</p>
      <p>Subsequent requests for the same configuration will return the same URL, unless the
        descriptor store entry has timed out.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Descriptor store</h2>
      <p>The descriptor store associates unique identifiers with the parameters required by a
        particular operation.</p>
      <p>The store looks for a requested identifier and returns it to the media agent. If there is
        no match, an entry is added and the new identifier is returned. As entries are inserted or
        retrieved, timestamps on those entries are updated. A configurable timeout value is used to
        determine when an entry expires.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Operation engine</h2>
      <p>When MAP receives a request from a device, it extracts the identifier, and requests the
        transcoded asset from the operation engine. The operation engine dispatches the request to
        the registered transcoder plugins for processing.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Transcoder plugins</h2>
      <p>MAP comes with the following plugins.</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Image Processor</dt>
        <dd>Transcodes and modifies a wide variety of image types. All images are handled
          internally.</dd>
        <dt>Standard Transcoding Interface (STI)</dt>
        <dd>Allows MAP to convert simple requests into complex STI requests that can be directed to
          a specified STI provider</dd>
        <dt>Identity</dt>
        <dd>Returns information about the received request to the client</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>When servicing a request, <em>all</em> plugins are asked if they wish to handle it. The
        results returned to the client are those provided by the first plugin that claims to handle
        the request. Once a plugin accepts a request, no attempt is made to check other plugins. So
        if the first plugin subsequently fails, the client will receive an error message.</p>
      <p>The plugin generates the media resource content, and MAP returns the content to the device.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To process audio and video resources using an STI transcoder, as distinct
        from using a trancoding service, you will have to develop custom plugins.</div>
    
    
      <h2>ICS servlet</h2>
      <p>A separate servlet, takes ICS native and transforce URLs and internally invokes the built
        in image processing plugin.</p>
      
      <p>ICS supports the use of convertible image variants. Each set of convertible image variants
        resident in a particular location should be assigned an asset group. The actual images do
        not need to reside on the ICS server. The asset group must indicate the URL of the ICS
        server, not the variant location itself. The server for the actual image variants may be
        indicated using appropriate URL parameters or the default image host will be used as
        specified in the <span class="filepath">ics-config.xml</span> file. If using a non-default image
        host, the image host name should be provided using either the <em>v.imgHost</em> or the
          <em>tf.source.host</em> parameter.</p>
      
      <p>When a convertible image variant is rendered at runtime, the variant URL is created
        dynamically using the asset group, variant value and the associated transcoding rule
        specified for the target device in the MCS device repository.</p>
