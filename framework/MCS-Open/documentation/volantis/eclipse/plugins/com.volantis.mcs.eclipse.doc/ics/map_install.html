    <p>Media Access Proxy (MAP) has a separate installer. However, there is an option in the MCS
      installer to set the URL of the MAP web application. After MAP is installed you should review
      the features of the ICS servlet, and configure the parameter and log settings as required. </p>
    
      <h2>Required software</h2>
      <p>MAP requires a JNDI datasource to be configured in your application server. To enable
        caching of transcoded assets, you should install the Squid Internet Object Cache server. You
        can obtain Squid from <span class="code">http://www.squid-cache.org/</span>.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Install options</h2>
      <p>The Image Conversion Service (ICS) can transcode images between various image formats. It
        can also perform scaling and watermarking operations. Installation of this module will also
        install a servlet that allows MAP to behave like earlier versions of ICS.</p>
      <p>The Example Service is a simple plugin service that just returns the request URL.</p> 
      <p>The Standard Transcoder Service (STI) plugin allows MAP to convert simple GET requests into
        complex STI requests that can be directed to a specified STI provider.</p>
    
    
      <h2>Running the installer</h2>
      <p>The installation wizard steps you through a series of pages. Most of the installer values
        have defaults. When you have completed a section, click <span class="command">Next</span> to move to
        the next page, or click <span class="command">Previous</span> to review or modify any values.</p>
      <p>The installer uses the entries to write to the related section of the configuration file.
      You can edit this file at any time after installation if you need to change the settings.</p>
      <p>When the installation is complete you can choose to save an automated installation file at a
        convenient location. Then you can repeat the installation on another machine with the path to
        the configuration file as a parameter.</p>
      <p>The following steps assume that you have selected all the install options.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Start the installer with the command <pre class="code">
java -jar map_installer-5.1.jar</pre>
        </li>
        <li>Choose the <span class="uicontrol">Accept</span> option to accept the license agreement</li>
        <li>Select the required install packs</li>
        <li>On the next page, accept the default server <span class="uicontrol">URL</span> and
            <span class="uicontrol">Port</span> values or enter new settings</li>
        <li>Optionally add a <span class="uicontrol">Watermark URL</span></li>
        <li>Accept the <span class="uicontrol">In memory IO buffering</span> and I<span class="uicontrol">CS native
          mode</span> settings</li>
        <li>Enter an <span class="uicontrol">Originator ID</span> and <span class="uicontrol">STI service URL</span></li>
        <li>Accept the default installation directory or choose an alternate location</li>
        <li>The installer displays a summary of all installation choices. Use the
          <span class="command">Previous</span> button to go back and change any options. When you are
          satisfied with all your choices, click <span class="command">Install</span> to start the
          installation, and <span class="command">Quit</span> to close the installer.</li>
        <li>Optionally save your installation settings by clicking <span class="command">Generate an automatic
          installation script</span>, and naming the file. To repeat the installation run the
          following command. <pre class="code">
java -jar map_installer-5.1.jar [configuration_file]</pre></li>
        <li>Copy the <span class="filepath">[install_directory]/webapps/map</span> directory to your web
          application server.</li>
        <li>Follow the instructions in <em>Configuring MAP</em></li>
      </ol>
    
    
      <h2>Testing your installation</h2>
      <p>Now test that MAP has been properly installed by converting a <span class="filepath">.gif</span>
        image.</p>
