Provides a framework for implementing and using mock objects.

<h2>Mock Object Framework</h2>

<h3>What is a Mock Object ?</h3>

<p>A mock object is an implementation of an interface (or extension of a class)
that can be used to test an object that depends on the implemented interface or
class. An important point to make is that the mock object is not the object
that is under test. A typical mock object will have the following
characteristics.</p>

<ul>
    <li>No built in behaviour.</li>
    <li>Completely customisable by the test.</li>
    <li>Detects errors as soon as possible.</li>
    <li>One implementation per class or interface.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Framework</h3>

<p>The framework is designed around the following usage:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Each test has a set of expectations about how the test object will
    interact with the mock objects. These expectations may be split into
    different sets for each mock object, or may apply across many objects.</li>

    <li>An interaction (method invocation) between the test object and a mock
    object results in an event being produced by the mock object.</li>

    <li>The event is checked against the applicable expectations.</li>

    <li>If the event matches an expectation then the expectation is
    satisfied.</li>

    <li>If the event does not match any expectations then the test has
    failed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The steps are repeated until either the test has failed, or all the
expectations were satisfied. In this case the test has completed.</p>

<h3>Expectations</h3>

<p>An expectation is simply a condition that needs to be satisfied during a
test. Expectations are satisfied by a matching event. An event is something
that happens to an object, typically a method call. Expectations can be composed
together into sequences, or sets. A sequence consists of a number of
expectations that have to be satisfied in order, a set consists of a number of
expectations that can be satisfied in any order.</p>

<p>Each mock object has an associated collection of expectations. By default
each object has its own empty sequence of expectations but this can be changed
by using the {@link MockObject#setExpectations} method. Using this method a
test can force two or more objects to share the same collection of
expectations, or change the expectation collection from a sequence to a
set.</p>

<p>If an object has no expectations set then it is assumed that it will not be
used at all in which case if any of its methods are called then it will cause
the test to fail.</p>

<h3 id="implementing">Implementing a Mock Object</h3>

<p>It is extremely simple (albeit tedious) to implement a MockObject (at least
for an interface) and therefore makes a perfect candidate for some form of
automatic generation based on reflection or parsing of Java, or by using
dynamic proxies added in JDK 1.3. In the meantime take a look at
{@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.example.MockFoo} for an example of how to
implement one by hand.</p>

<p>An implementation of a mock object consists of the following items:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Unique identifiers for each method.</li>
    <li>Mock implementations of each method.</li>
    <li>Additional methods for adding expectations.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are two types of methods for adding expectations, exact matches and
fuzzy matches. The former have names that start with <code>expect</code> while
the latter have names that start with <code>accept</code>. The rest of the
method name is constructed by appending the mock method name after capitalising
the first letter.</p>

<p>Each type of method accepts a parameter for each parameter of the
associated method plus an additional optional one for specifying what should
happen once the expectation has been satisfied. This is supplied as an
instance of the {@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.method.MethodAction}
interface.</p>

<p>The expect method's parameters have the same types as the mock method's.
The expected values will match the actual values if they are equal as defined
by {@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.impl.value.ExpectedEqual}.</p>

<p>The accept method's parameters use Object instead of the mock method's
types. This is to allow some or all of the parameters to be specified
as instances of {@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.value.ExpectedValue} in
order to provide explicit control over how the expected values are matched
against the actual values.</p>

<p>If the mock method does not have any parameters, e.g. it is a getter, then
no accept method is needed.</p>

<h3>Testing Using a Mock Object</h3>

<p>The basic steps to test using a mock object are as follows:</p>

<ol>
    <li>Create the mock objects.</li>

    <li>Create the object being tested, passing in any mock objects that it
    needs.</li>

    <li>Set the expectations.</li>

    <li>Invoke the methods to test.</li>

    <li>Repeat the last two steps until the test is complete.</li>
</ol>

<p>Sometimes it is not possible to determine whether an expectation has been
satisfied during the test, e.g. if a method is expected to be called twice but
is only called once. In this case you need to verify the mock objects. If you
extend the {@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.test.MockTestCaseAbstract} then
it will automatically verify the objects as long as the body of the test has
succeeded. If for some reason you cannot do that then you should add the
following code around the body of the test. This will ensure that all the
mock objects that are created during the test will be verified to make sure
that their expectations were satisfied.</p>

<pre>    boolean worked = false;
    try {
        MockTestHelper.begin();

        // Body of the test here.

        worked = true;
    } finally {
        MockTestHelper.end(worked);
    }</pre>

<p>Rather than duplicating the above code in each test you can use a command
pattern to encapsulate the test body and call that from within a single
test. Conceptually this is what the
{@link com.volantis.testtools.mock.test.MockTestCaseAbstract} does except that
it uses the JUnit reflection mechanism for invoking the test rather than a pure
command pattern.</p>
