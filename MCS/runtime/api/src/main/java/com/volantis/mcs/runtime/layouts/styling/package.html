Describes how layout styling is applied within the runtime.

<h2>Layout Styling</h2>

<p>Layout and format styles can come from two different places, from the layout
and format itself and also from a theme via a style class. Where there is a
collision the styles from the theme win. The challenge is to ensure that
the styles are applied consistently whatever their source.</p>

<p>As themes is the main and most general mechanism we have for styling it makes
sense to turn all stylistic information into themes, combine them in various
ways and then apply them consistently.</p>

<p>Therefore, during activation of the layout at runtime the layout and format
styles will be turned into a style sheet which is then compiled into a form that
can then be applied. Each rule within the style sheet will have a selector that
only matches the format for which the selector was created. The specificity of
these selectors will be set to the lowest possible to ensure that they are
overridden by any other appropriate rule from the theme.</p>

<p>At runtime a special styling engine will be created from the layout's
compiled style sheet. This will then have the current theme's (if any) compiled
style sheet pushed onto it and will be used by the format renderers to determine
their styles.</p>

<h2>Format Selector</h2>

<p>For backwards compatability reasons (and to protect the customer from having
to know too much about the internals of the product) we need to ensure that the
selectors we create for the formats cannot collide with any of the selectors
that the customer could provide in their themes. Ideally we would like to be
able to create special matchers for formats but that would unfortunately expose
too much of the internals outside the styling package and would also require
changes to its API. Therefore, instead we will use some special combination of
the existing selectors to ensure that they cannot conflict with rules from a
theme.</p>

<p>The selectors for the formats need to be overrideable by all other selectors
but as they will contain all sorts of selectors if they used the normal rules
for calculating specificity then they would only be overrideable by some
selectors and not others. Therefore, a different specificity calculator will
be provided to the compiler to produce a specificity that is always 0.</p>

<h2>Format Styling Engine</h2>

<p>As indicated above the proposed solution is not perfect because it forces
the formats to be mapped onto elements. Unfortunately, the cost of modifying the
styling engine to support styling things other than elements, providing
additional selectors in the style sheet and exposing enough of the internals of
the styling engine to allow custom selectors to be turned into custom matchers
is prohibitive at the moment. Therefore, to reduce the amount of exposure that
there is to this slight ugliness a special format styling engine interface will
be created that provides a type safe way of styling formats. This will map
the format to the appropiate element and attributes so that the selectors that
were created for that format will match.</p>

<p>In this way the only thing that needs to change should the styling engine
be able to style things other than elements would be the internals of this
and the class that builds the selectors.</p>
