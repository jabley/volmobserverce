      <p>You can configure a new MCS project on your machine to enable
         you to collaborate with other users on editing components,
         layouts and themes. In a project configured this way, MCS uses a
         JDBC repository to refresh XML project files on local machines, and allows team members to hold locks on policy and variants attributes.</p>
      <p>You specify a connection to a database repository, and
         provide a display name that can be used to view your own
         locks, and so that other users can contact you if they need
         you to unlock a resource. MCS downloads the project policies,
         and updates the policies at regular intervals.</p>
      <p>You should contact your administrator for information on
         database access, and for the conventions on display names.</p>
      <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: The display name that identifies users must be
         unique in order to sensibly identify locks on resources. MCS
         associates this name with a specific project on a single
         user's machine. It is not bound to any other system of user
         naming.</div>
      <ol>
         <li>In the Project Settings page of the New Project wizard,
            check the <span class="uicontrol">Enable collaborative
            working</span> option to enable the remaining
            controls. The <span class="uicontrol">Database project name</span>
            contains the project name</li>
         <li>Enter the required name of the policy repository
               <span class="uicontrol">Database</span>
         </li>
         <li>Fill in the <span class="uicontrol">Host</span>,
            <span class="uicontrol">Port</span>,
            <span class="uicontrol">Username</span>, and
            <span class="uicontrol">Password</span> for the database, based on
            the information you received from the administrator</li>
         <li>Enter an identifier in <span class="uicontrol">My display
            name</span>. Usually this will be an e-mail or
            instant messenger address that uniquely identifies you.</li>
         <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span>. MCS displays a dialog
            while it copies the project files to the XML repository on
            your machine. </li>
      </ol>
      <p>The new project icon appears in the Navigator pane. Any
         existing project resources will be displayed in folders under
         it.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Changing project settings</h2>
         <p>Once you have created a collaborative project there is no
            way to change either the database, or the policy source directory.
            You can change to another device repository using the
            project Properties dialog, though it is advisable that
            everyone collaborating on a project use the same device
            policies. Other controls will be read only.</p>
         <p>If you no longer want the policy files to be part of a
            collaborative project, you must create a new project, and
            either copy the XML policy folders to it, or export them
            from the database.</p>
            <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You should not change the names of any project folders. If you do so it is possible that the policy files will not be recognized as part of the project.</div>
