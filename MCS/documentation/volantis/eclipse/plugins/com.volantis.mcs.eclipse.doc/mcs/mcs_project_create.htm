<h1>Creating a project</h1>
<p>A project is a set of resources that you define for a particular web application. 
  Resources that make up a project could include XML or JSP files, assets, layout, 
  theme, component and device policies.</p>
<p>MCS organizes resources according to project, so you can arrange for
  multiple projects to share the same policy repository.</p>
<p>In MCS, you can use the New Project wizard to add a new project to the Workbench. 
  The wizard allows you to define:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A project name and location</li>
  <li>Project settings for a device repository and a source directory</li>
</ul>
<h2>Naming the project</h2>
<p>The first page allows you to locate and name the project, and the location 
  of the project contents.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose the <a href="mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="MCS Project wizard">MCS 
    Project wizard</a></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
  <li>Enter a name in the <span class="uicontrol">Project name</span> text box</li>
  <li>To choose a location other than the Workbench, uncheck the <span class="uicontrol">Use 
    default</span> checkbox, and click <span class="command">Browse</span> to 
    select a system folder</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Defining project settings</h2>
<p>On the next page you must enter values for the location of the project device 
  repository, and name the source directory. There can only one policy source 
  directory per project, and all your MCS resources must be in this directory 
  or one under it.</p>
<p>The device repository can be any one on your system that is appropriate for 
  this project. The default path of the source directory is 'WebContent/mcs-policies', 
  but you can use any name you wish.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the <span class="command">Browse</span> button to locate the device 
    repository provided with MCS. The repository filename must have a .mdpr extension.</li>
  <li>Enter a name in the <span class="uicontrol">Policy source directory</span> 
    control, or accept the default</li>
  <li>Click <span
  class="command">Finish.</span> The new project icon appears in the Navigator 
    pane</li>
  <li>To view the project contents, select the icon and choose <span class="command">File</span> | <span class="command">Refresh</span>. 
    Now expand the project.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Adding MCS resources to an existing project</h2>
<p>You can add MCS resources to an existing project, such as a company web site, 
  by adding a folder to your project. This will be your policy source directory. 
  You do not have to create an MCS project.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose an existing folder or right click on a project folder and choose 
    <span class="command">New</span> | <span class="command">Folder</span>. With a 
    new folder you can use any name, but a name like 'MCS policies' will be meaningful.</li>
  <li>Now choose an <a href="mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="MCS wizard">MCS wizard</a> 
    for the resource you want to add</li>
  <li>On the MCS settings page in the wizard click <span class="command">Browse</span> 
    to locate a device repository for the project</li>
  <li>Continue with the wizard to complete adding the resource</li>
</ol>
<p>MCS displays the resource icon in the new folder, and opens an editor on the 
  resource.</p>
