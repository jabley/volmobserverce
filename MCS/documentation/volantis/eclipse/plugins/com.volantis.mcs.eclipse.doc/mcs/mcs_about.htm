<h1>About MCS<img src="../images/mcs_project_banner.gif" width="75" height="58" align="left" alt="MCS Project icon"></h1>
<p>The Multi-Channel Server (MCS) helps you manage the complexity of delivering 
  a wide variety of content to PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, interactive digital TV, 
  internet appliances, games consoles, VoiceXML and interactive kiosks.</p>
<p>To deliver to multiple channels, you need to present content, services and 
  applications in a consistent way across all target devices. In MCS you can separate 
  application design from device delivery, and build a cost-effective and scalable 
  system, by defining policies.</p>
<h2>Policies</h2>
<p>In MCS you use policies to establish detailed control over visual appearance 
  and behavior. This policy design information, which MCS holds in a shared repository, 
  combines templates, digital media assets, layouts and stylistic policies for 
  your content.</p>
