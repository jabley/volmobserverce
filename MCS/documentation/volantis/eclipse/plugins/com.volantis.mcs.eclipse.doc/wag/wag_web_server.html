      <h1>Directing web servers</h1>
      
      <p>You can use server side includes (SSI) in XDIME to direct a
         web server to do some basic processing. Some site
         configurations include web servers in addition to application
         servers. They deliver static content, and can supply some
         additional processing, which is controlled by directives
         embedded in the response to a request.</p>
      
      <p>For example, you can include content directly in the
         generated response without requiring the browser to request
         it independently. Individual content components can be cached
         when originally generated, and then replaced in the response
         from the application server by SSI directives that cause
         their inclusion directly from the cache.</p>
      
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: 
			The included material is not processed in any way by the
         web server. The XDIME inclusion mechanism enables support for
         caching systems, but is not intended as a replacement for
         other types of inclusion.</p>
      
         
      <h2>The SSI directives</h2>
         
      <p>You use the <span class="code">ssiconfig</span> to included
            additional material.Two mutually exclusive attributes
            specify the added content. The <span class="code">virtual</span>
            attribute defines a URL on the web server. This form of
            include is useful when the material is remote from the
            directory containing the page with the directive. The
               <span class="code">file</span> attribute defines a relative file
            path. It is probably most useful when the include is in
            the same directory that contains the page, or is close to
            it.</p>
         
      <p>The <span class="code">ssiconfig</span> element can contain an
            error message to be written in the event of a failure. It
            takes a single <span class="code">errmsg</span> attribute.</p>
         
      <pre class="code">&lt;wsdirectives&gt;
   &lt;ssiconfig errmsg="The file 'Q4report.html'is not available."/&gt;
   &lt;ssiinclude virtual="/mycorp/sales 2004/Q4report.html"/&gt;
&lt;/wsdirectives&gt;</pre>
