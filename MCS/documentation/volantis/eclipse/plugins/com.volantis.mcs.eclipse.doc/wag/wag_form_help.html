      <h1 class="ocp">Form help and prompts</h1>
		
      <p>You can supply help and prompts to help users complete XDIME forms, at both form and individual control level. Nearly all form elements have a <span class="code">help</span> and a <span class="code">prompt</span> attribute, or both. The attributes can contain literal text, a MCS or JSP expression, or VoiceXML that is valid in the context of the element in use.</p>
		
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: MCS does not generate any VoiceXML markup. The entire content to be processed by the browser must be contained in the attributes.</p>

      <h2>Help</h2>		
		
      <p>Help is not supported in either HTML or WML. In VoiceXML, MCS renders the content for the <span class="code">help</span> element. The example repeats the most recent prompt after a short delay.</p>
		
			
      <pre class="code">
&lt;help&gt;Select the drink you would like.
   &lt;break msecs='500'/&gt;
   &lt;reprompt/&gt;
&lt;/help&gt;</pre>

      <h2>Prompts</h2>

      <p>Prompts are not supported in WML. In HTML 4.0 or later, MCS uses the prompt content to display pop-up help - earlier versions do not support help. In VoiceXML, MCS renders the content for the <span class="code">prompt</span> element.</p>

      <pre class="code">&lt;prompt&gt;Would you like coffee, tea or milk?
&lt;/prompt&gt;</pre>

      <p>You have complete control over the VoiceXML used in prompts, so it is possible to use the full range of language features, including counts. For example, you can provide different prompts depending on the number of times the prompt has been delivered.</p>
					
						
      <pre class="code">
&lt;prompt&gt;Enter the item number.&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;prompt count="3"&gt;Say the item number of the product you
wish to buy, or enter it on the keypad.
&lt;/prompt&gt;
&lt;prompt count="5"&gt;If you need help, enter zero.
Otherwise, say the item number of the
product you wish to buy, or enter it on the keypad.  
&lt;/prompt&gt;</pre>
					
					
      <p>With complex, multiple prompts to process, you may find it better to code the attribute as a MCS expression.</p>
					
      <p>You can also use audio prompts in place of text.</p>

      <pre class="code">
&lt;prompt&gt;
   &lt;audio src="drinks.wav"&gt;Would you like coffee, tea or milk?&lt;/audio&gt;
&lt;/prompt&gt;</pre>	

					
      <p>In this version, the audio clip drinks.wav is played if available. If not, the text in the body of the <span class="code">audio</span> tag is played instead.</p>
					
      <p class="note">
         <strong>Note</strong>: When you reference external assets from a prompt, the reference is to the asset itself, and not to an MCS component. To provide different assets for different devices, you can create targeted text variants to contain the different prompts.</p>
