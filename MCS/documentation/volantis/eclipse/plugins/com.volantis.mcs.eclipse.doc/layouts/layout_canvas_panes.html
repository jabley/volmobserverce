<h1>Canvas layouts and panes</h1>
<p>A canvas is an layout area where you can position formatting objects and associate 
  them with elements in your web content. On a PC, MCS delivers a canvas as a 
  single web page. On smaller devices, MCS sends complex canvasses as sets of 
  pages.</p>
<p>The figure shows a canvas layout, designed to display help text on a PC , as 
  it appears in the Design page of the Layout editor.</p>
<p>An outer grid consists of two columns. The left column contains a another grid 
  with three panes for sections in a table of contents, and the right column contains 
  a single pane for topics. </p>
<p>MCS displays the content in individual panes. Since there are four panes, and 
  four places where content can be displayed, each pane has a unique name within 
  the layout. In the content, you use the pane names to specify where output from 
  XDIME elements appears. </p>
<p><img src="../images/layout_canvas.png" alt="A canvas layout with panes" /></p>
<p>You assign attributes to each format, including every pane. These attributes 
  determine the formatting that is applied as the page is generated. For example, 
  you might decide to center the layout of each of the table of contents panes 
  and left align the Topic content. </p>
<p>MCS flows content in normal panes, so headings and paragraphs, and lists will 
  format on the page as you expect.</p>
<p>When you add a pane and name it, you are creating a target for part of the 
  content. You use the name of the pane in the XDIME on the web page to map content 
  to the pane. In the example a paragraph is mapped to the pane named Topic using 
  the <span class="code">pane</span> attribute.</p>
<pre class="code">&lt;p pane=&quot;Topic&quot;&gt;
The Multi-Channel Server (MCS) helps you manage the complexity of delivering
a wide variety of content to PCs, PDAs, mobile phones, interactive digital TV,
internet appliances, games consoles, VoiceXML and interactive kiosks.
