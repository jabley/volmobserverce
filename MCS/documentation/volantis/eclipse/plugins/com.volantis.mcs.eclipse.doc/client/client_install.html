      <p>The Client Framework package is installed automatically by the MCS installer. So it can be
         accessed over HTTP, in the same way as the rest of the default MCS web application.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Sample Application</h2>
         <p>The Client Framework sample application is a part of the MCS package and can be used to
            demonstrate functionality or test devices. The sample application has a home page with a
            menu linking to a sub pages for AJAX and non-AJAX widgets, and a page demonstrating the
            transition effects. The sample application files are located in
               <span class="filepath">webapps/mcs/projects/client-app/</span> under your installation
            directory.</p>
