<h1>MCS release notes</h1>
<p>The following is a summary of the changes to features and functionality
  in Multi-Channel Server (MCS) 5.0 for the Volantis Mobility Server
  Community Edition. Further information and details about existing functionality
  and features may be found in previous release notes and documentation.</p>
<p>You should also refer to the notes in <em>MCS Supported platforms</em>.</p>
<h2>Media Access Proxy</h2>
<p>The Media Access Proxy (MAP) is a web application that is used to
  perform transcoding and transformation operations on media files
  referenced by XDIME 2.Images are handled internally by the ICS
  servlet component and an image processor plugin.</p>
<p>As well as images, the proxy supports XDIME 2 references to external
  Standard Transcoding Interface (STI) services for audio and video
  MIME types.</p>
<h2>Configuring MCS</h2>
<p>The <span class="code">media-access-proxy</span> element in the <span class="filepath">mcs-config.xml</span> file contains the path to the
  Media Access Proxy (MAP) web application. The method of configuring
  of the path to the ICS servlet component is unchanged.</p>
<h2>Media support in XDIME 2</h2>
<p>Support is added for the <span class="code">srctype</span> attribute on the XDIME
  2 <span class="code">object</span> element. If it contains device
  independent types, then the <span class="code">src</span> attribute must be an
  MCS policy name with the extensions <span class="filepath">.mauc</span>, <span class="filepath">.mdyv</span> or <span class="filepath">.mimg</span>. They
  must also all be of the same family, that is all video, all audio,
  all image, or all application/x-shockwave-flash.</p>
<p>Authors can specify the <span class="code">mcs-external-label</span> parameter in <span class="code">object</span> elements, which defines the content
  used for a link to an external resource, without having to know the
  exact media type type.</p>
<p>The <span class="code">mcs-media-style</span> style property determines whether
  an <span class="code">object</span> element should be treated as part of a
  page or an external resource that a user will explicitly
  retrieve.</p>
<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You should always specify values for the <span class="code">width</span> and <span class="code">height</span> attributes to ensure that the <span class="code">object</span> element will work for all devices.</div>
<h2>Multiple submissions in XDIME 2 forms</h2>
<p>The <span class="code">xf:setvalue</span> element can be used to associate
  a specific <span class="code">xf:submit</span> control with the value to be
  submitted when there are multiple submit buttons on a form. The <span class="code">value</span> attribute contains the value to be submitted.
  If it is not present then the content of the element is used as the
  value.</p>
<h2>Documentation</h2>
<p>In addition to these release notes, the following documents are
  published. Online documentation is also available on the Community edition website.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em>Volantis Mobility Server Installation</em> (PDF)</li>
  <li><em>MCS Help</em> (XHTML) is packaged with the Eclipse plugins.
    Related installation and administration documentation, is also
    included for convenience.</li>
  <li><em>Device Repository Web Service API</em> (PDF)</li>
</ul>
<h2>Known MCS issues</h2>
<p>Customer support ticket references are given where applicable.</p>

<h2>Resolved MCS issues</h2>
<p>This section contains known issues that were listed in earlier
  release notes, and have since been resolved. Issues that were
  reported and resolved since the preceding release are not covered
  here. Refer to the file <span class="filepath">changes.lst</span> for more
  detailed information.</p>
<p>There are no issues in this category.</p>
<h2>Known Client Framework issues</h2>
<p>The following is a summary of known issues in Volantis MCF Client
  1.3. Details about existing features may be found in the
  documentation.</p>
<p>Client Framework functionality is limited by the browser
  capabilities.</p>
<p>Opera Mobile 8.6 limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wipe-top, grow and shrink effects are replaced by the
    slide-top effect</li>
  <li>The puff effect is replaced by the instant effect</li>
  <li>Effects which require scaling of content do not work smoothly
    for content other than inline/text</li>
  <li>Selected page element is marked by Opera browser with blue
    background. This feature can not be controlled by XDIME 2 author.</li>
  <li>The <span class="code">focus()</span> does not have an effect if the element
    to be focused is outside the visible part of the page</li>
  <li>If a displayed forms wizard step is bigger than the viewport
    size, but smaller then the rest of page content, the wizard does
    not cover all the page content and some of the content is visible
    if the user scrolls down the page.</li>
  <li>If position of Dynamic Menu is set to fixed, submenus disappear
    from the menu after scrolling document below the height of the
    viewport.</li>
  <li>It is impossible to cancel Wizard widget if Popup's dismiss
    buttons appear just above the input field</li>
  <li>The Field Expander widget does not support 'unfold on click'</li>
  <li>The slide transition works incorrectly with the Wizard
    widget</li>
</ul>
<p>Access NetFront 3.4 limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The wipe-top effect is replaced with slide-top</li>
  <li>In the NF 3.4 emulator scrollbars appear during the shrink/grow
    effects in Popup</li>
  <li>In the NF 3.4 emulator form controls appear always on top of
    everything. As a consequence, when a Popup widget appears over
    some form controls, they are still visible.</li>
  <li>When the puff or pulsate effects are used, the controls and
    links remain static.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following is a list of the <span class="uicontrol">Rounded
  corners</span> property limitations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Only the solid border style is supported</li>
  <li>It is ignored if applied to the body, table or form field
    elements</li>
  <li>Attempt to apply this property to inline element containing
    block elements leads to unspecified results</li>
  <li>On Gecko based browsers, for example Firefox and Mozilla, the
    shape of the corner will always be a quarter of circle, with
    curvature equal to the first value of the property.</li>
</ul>
