      <p>After installing the MCS application, setting up your application server
         and database if required, and completing any
         post-installation tasks you can now verify that your
         installation has been successful.</p>
      
         <h2>Displaying the welcome page</h2>
         <p>You can verify that your installation is working by
            displaying one of two welcome pages created during the web
            application server setup,
            <span class="filepath">welcome.xdime</span> and
               <span class="filepath">welcome.jsp</span>. The files are in the
               <span class="filepath">/MCS/webapps/welcome</span> directory on
            your application server.</p>
         <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you chose to use a database for runtime deployment,
            the appropriate policies need to exist within the database
            tables.</div>
         <p>Start the web application server and MCS and load a
            welcome page into a Web browser. If a page appears your
            installation is working.</p>
         <p>For example for a Tomcat installation, from a command
            prompt, navigate to the bin directory and issue the
               <span class="command">startup</span> command. The server will
            report its usual startup messages. This will also mean
            that the MCS server is effectively started and available.</p>
         <p>Start a web browser and enter a URL that references the
            web application instance, the directory and the welcome
            page. For example, if you are running the browser on the
            same machine as the server, you might use
               <span class="code">http://localhost:8080/[context_root]/welcome/welcome.xdime</span>
         </p>
         
      
      
         <h2>Accessing the policy editors</h2>
         <p>You need to start Eclipse to access the policy editors,
            for example <span class="filepath">C:\Program
            Files\eclipse\eclipse.exe</span>.</p>
         <p>You can then choose one of the MCS wizards for creating
            policies by choosing <span class="command">File</span> |
               <span class="command">New</span> | <span class="command">Other</span> |
               <span class="command">MCS</span>. See <em>Choosing a Wizard</em> for further information.</p>
        
         <p>If you wish to review the policies used by the welcome
            pages you can import them into an MCS project in Eclipse.</p>
         <p>To create a project see <em>Creating a project</em>.</p>
         <p class="taskhead">To import the welcome policies into the project:</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Expand the project and open the empty folder
                  <span class="filepath">mcs-policies</span>
            </li>
            <li>Right-click and choose <span class="command">Import</span> and
               then <span class="command">File System</span> and <span class="command">Next</span>
            </li>
            <li>Browse to pick up the policy definitions in the XML
               repository, for example <span class="filepath">C:\Program
                  Files\[context_root]\MCS\repository\xml-repository</span>
            </li>
            <li>Click <span class="command">Select all</span> and choose the
                  <span class="uicontrol">Create selected folders only</span>
               option</li>
               <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to import the files</li>
         </ol>
         <p>If you now expand the mcs-policies directory you will now
            see the imported policies for both the tutorial and
            welcome applications.</p>
             <div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: You can associate projects with the supplied device
               repository file <span class="filepath">devices.mdpr</span> which
               is located under the
                  <span class="filepath">/MCS/repository/device-repository</span>
               directory.</div>
      
      
         <h2>If you have problems</h2>
         <p>As MCS executes, by default it writes log and status
            information to a file named <span class="filepath">.log</span>. The
            file will be written to the log directory specified in the
               <span class="filepath">web.xml</span> file.</p>
