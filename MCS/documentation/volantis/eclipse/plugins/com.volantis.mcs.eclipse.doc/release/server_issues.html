         <p>The following points detail specific integration issues
            with individual application servers.</p>
            
         <h2>Tomcat 3.2</h2>
         <p> Tomcat 3.2 on Windows 2000 running Sun JDK 1.3 will
            randomly fail to create pages with the following error
            being reported:</p>
         
            <pre class="code">java.lang.OutOfMemoryErroranonymous-data-sourceanonymous-data-source
               &lt;&lt;no stack trace
               available&gt;&gt;</pre>
         
         <p>You will notice that the size of the JVM (java.exe) for
            tomcat is large ( &gt;70MB is possible).</p>
         <p>This is a tomcat/JDK compatibility issue, and is a known
            and reported problem. Please review the following for
            further information:</p>
         
            <pre class="code">http://w4.metronet.com/~wjm/
               tomcat/2000/Dec/msg00346.html</pre>
         
      
      
         <h2>Tomcat 3.x and WebSphere 4 and Portals</h2>
         <p>Neither Tomcat 3.x nor WebSphere 4 support jsp:include
            fully. This means that they cannot be used for Portals
            with MCS.</p>
         <p>For Tomcat, Tomcat 4.0 is required for portal
         inclusions.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Tomcat Reported Problem</h2>
         <p>A problem has been found with Tomcat which has been
            reported to Apache and can be found under the following
            reference.</p>
         
            <pre class="code">http://nagoya.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=4542</pre>
         
         <p>This is not a serious problem as it only arises when a
            problem has already occurred. It can be worked around by
            ensuring that any included page does not have an error
            page.</p>
