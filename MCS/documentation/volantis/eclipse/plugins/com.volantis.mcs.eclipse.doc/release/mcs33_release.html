      <p>The following is a summary of the changes to features and
         functionality in MCS 3.3. Further information and details
         about existing functionality and features may be found in
         previous release notes and documentation.</p>
      <p>You should also refer to the notes in <em>Supported platforms</em> and <em>Application server issues</em>.</p>
      
         <h2>Java and Eclipse</h2>
         <p>From version 3.3 the MCS policy editors require JDK 1.4.2
            and Eclipse 3.0 or later. JDK 1.2 is no longer
         supported.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Layout styles</h2>
         <p>In the Layout editor you can now associate themes with the
            following formats.</p>
         <ul class="simple"><li class="simple">Grid</li><li class="simple">Grid column</li><li class="simple">Grid row</li><li class="simple">Spatial iterator</li><li class="simple">Spatial iterator column</li><li class="simple">Spatial iterator row</li></ul>
      
      <h2>Drag and drop</h2>
      <p>Drag and drop support has been added to the Eclipse environment for MCS. This support is mainly for layouts, but it is also now possible to drag image files into the assets section of an image component editor to create assets for that component.</p>
      <p>There is an issue on the Linux version of Eclipse which will be fixed with the 3.1 release of Eclipse. If a layout format is dragged and dropped onto an empty format as a copy on the Design page, Eclipse will hang. This is not a problem in the Outline view.</p>
      
         <h2>Spatial iterators</h2>
         <p>The use of spatial iterators is extended to include two
            new contexts.</p>
         <p>You can now place iterators inside a form to display
            tabular data.</p>
         <p>It is also possible to enclose regions, so that variable
            numbers of portlets or content sources can be combined in
            a single layout. The syntax for using a fixed region name
            outside a format iterator is unchanged. Inside an
            iterator, you use an MCS expression
            layout:getRegionInstance() that takes a string and a
            series of integer index values to refer to the instances
            of the regions within the iterator. For example:</p>
         <pre class="code">
&lt;region name="{layout:getRegionInstance('name', 0, 1, 2, 3)}"&gt; ... &lt;region&gt; </pre>
      
      
         <h2>Disabling branding</h2>
         <p>A new method of disabling branding has been implemented.</p>
         <p>The deprecated use of the caret (^) character is replaced
            with the function
            branding:getUnbrandedPolicy('policyName'), for example </p>
         <pre class="code">
&lt;img src="^logo.mimg" alt="Logo"/&gt;</pre>
         <p>should be replaced with the expression</p>
         
            <pre class="code">
&lt;img src="branding:getUnbrandedPolicy('logo.mimg')"/&gt;</pre>
         
      
      
         <h2>Importing theme information</h2>
         <p>MCS now supports the importing of style properties in
            themes from a parent device theme in the device hierarchy.
            So you can build up complex themes that share core
            branding styles at say the master level, and adjust these
            at device family or specific device level. The default is
            not to import themes. Refer to <em>Adding a theme</em> to see how designers can control theme import.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Numeric menu labels</h2>
         <p>You can now specify that accesskeys on a menuitem can
            rendered as numeric labels. Both WML and XHTML devices are
            supported. The selector pseudo-elements 'shortcut' and
            'shortcut-after' take the style rules for the numeric
            label and a separator. </p><p>A new Content category with a
            single <span class="uicontrol">Content</span> property contains
            the text separating the label from the menuitem. The Menu
            category has an added <span class="uicontrol">Menu Item Shortcut
            Active</span> control to switch numbering on or
         off.</p>
      
      
         <h2>White space styling in WML forms</h2>
         <p>WML styling in XDIME single and multiple select elements
            is improved in this release.</p>
         <p>When you apply a white-space property with a value of
            'nowrap' to the <span class="code">xfsiselect</span> or
               <span class="code">xfmuselect</span> elements in a form, MCS
            wraps the output in a <span class="code">p</span> element with
            the <span class="code">mode</span> attribute set to 'nowrap'. If the
            caption and field are written to the same pane, they are
            wrapped in the same paragraph, otherwise they are wrapped
            separately.</p>
      
      
         <h2>WCSS support</h2>
         <p>This release extends support to the CSS2-based styles
            defined in WCSS, a subset of CSS2 for WAP2. The
            WAP-specific styles in this specification are not
            supported.</p>
      
      
         <h2>MySQL support</h2>
         <p>Support has been added for the use of the MySQL database
            for JDBC repositories. Owing to the maximum size of
            primary key allowed in MySQL, only versions 4.1.6 or later
            are recommended. There is a compile option that can be set
            to increase the primary key size on earlier versions, but
            that may be undesirable.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Device search</h2>
         <p>The search feature in the Eclipse workbench has been
            extended to include searching the MCS device repository.
            The search allows users to search for devices by name or
            use regular expressions in the search. From the search
            results, users can navigate to each match in the device
            editor. See <em>Searching a device repository</em> in for further information.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Null asset</h2>
         <p>It is now possible to set a 'null' value for assets on
            every component that can have targetable assets. During
            fallback, if the first asset encountered for a component
            is a null asset, then the result is the same as if no
            asset (of any type) existed for that component anywhere in
            the fallback path. Refer to <em>Using the asset type attribute</em> for details.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Loading image assets</h2>
         <p>You can use the load-asset CLI to load large numbers of
            MCS image components and their assets from the file system
            or a URL to an XML repository in a single operation. You
            can rerun the loader at any time following a change one or
            more images.</p>
         <p>You specify a target policy folder and a directory tree
            containing directories named for each component, and
            sub-directories for each asset type. (device, convertible
            or generic). When MCS loads the images, it creates a
            series of image components in the target policy folder,
            with assets of the type in the sub folders. Image metadata
            is also interpreted to generate the necessary attributes
            automatically.</p>
      
      
         <h2>Changes to MarinerRequestContext API</h2>
         <p>The method <span class="code">MarinerRequestContext.setContentTypeCharSet(String)</span> has been replaced with <span class="code">MarinerRequestContext.setCharacterEncoding(String)</span>.</p>
        
      
      
         <h2>Changes to MCS documentation</h2>
         <p>As part of an ongoing transition to modular documentation,
            the guide to Dynamic Content Integration, and the entire
            XDIME element reference have been added to the the Eclipse
            documentation along with MCS Help. The MCS Administration
            Guide and the related MCS Configuration Element Reference
            are also available in Eclipse.</p>
         <p>See <em>MCS site map</em> for an overview of available documents.</p>
