    <title>Updating a device repository</title>
  </head>

  <body>
<h1>Device repository update service</h1>
<p>Because new devices are always being added by manufacturers, and over 200 attributes 
  are recorded for many devices, the MCS repository is continually reviewed and 
  updated.</p>
<p>You can obtain updates to a standard device repository from the update service 
  over the Web, or update one or more projects from an recent download to your 
  file system.</p>
<p>The update service requires a login; there is also an option to define the 
  URL address and port of a proxy server, together with a username and password.</p>

<h2>Repository versions</h2>
<p>When you use the update service, you can choose the location of a repository 
  to update, and you can optionally pick a specific revision of the standard repository. 
  The revision identifier will usually consist of a date and version in the form 
  yyyymmddvv. A description gives a brief overview of the changes.</p>
<h2>Update methods</h2>
<p>You can also specify whether the update should be merged with the existing 
  repository, overwrite it, or saved to another file.</p>
<dl>
  <dt>Merge</dt>
  <dd>Merge is the default setting. The update adds new device information to 
    standard policies in the repository. Any changes you have made to identification 
    patterns or policy values are not overwritten. No policies are removed, and 
    existing devices retain their position in the hierarchy. </dd>
  <dt>Overwrite</dt>
  <dd>The new repository replaces the current one entirely. Any changes you have 
    made are overwritten.</dd>
  <dt>Save to file</dt>
  <dd>The new repository is saved to a different file location. The existing repository 
    is unchanged</dd>
</dl>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Merge does not affect any custom policies 
  you have defined.</p>
