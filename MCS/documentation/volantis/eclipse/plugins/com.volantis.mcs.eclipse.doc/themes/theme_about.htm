<h1>About themes<img src="../images/theme_banner.gif" width="75" height="58" align="left" alt="Theme icon"></h1>
<p>In MCS you can design themes that will provide an overall look and feel to 
  your web site. Each theme can be defined for individual devices and groups of 
  devices.</p>
<p>A theme is made up of a set of style rules, and each rule is identified by 
  a selector, and has a set of properties.</p>
<p>While you use layouts to specify the physical position of elements on pages, 
  you employ style rules for values such as, fonts, colors, backgrounds and borders. 
</p>
<p>Styles are device-dependent because devices differ greatly in the support available 
  for this kind of information. So MCS has to identify the requesting device before 
  applying a set of rules.</p>
