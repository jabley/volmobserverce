<h1>Adding a selector</h1>
<p>On the Theme editor Design page you can add or edit selectors that are associated 
  with element names, class attributes or id attributes in the XML data the device 
  will display. For example, you'll want to create selectors for headings, paragraphs, 
  links and so on.</p>
<p>The Selector list has two columns. The <span class="uicontrol">Selector</span> 
  column contains the names of one or more selectors. The <span class="uicontrol">Order</span> 
  column indicates the order the style rules.</p>
<p>You can use the Style Rule wizard to create a sequence of style selectors for 
  the selector column or simply edit the text. In the wizard you can set values 
  for the following selectors:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Element</li>
  <li>Psuedo-class</li>
  <li>Pseudo-element</li>
  <li>Class</li>
  <li>Id</li>
</ul>
<p class="taskhead">To add a selector:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Browse</span> to start the Style Rule wizard.</li>
  <li>Set values for an <span class="uicontrol">Element</span>, and its <span class="uicontrol">Class</span> 
    or <span class="uicontrol">Id</span> attributes, or for a <span class="uicontrol">Pseudo 
    Class</span> or <span class="uicontrol">Pseudo Element</span></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Add</span> to add the selection to the <span class="uicontrol">Selector 
    Group</span></li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Up</span> or <span class="command">Down</span> 
    to change the order of the selectors in the rule</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also click <span class="command">Add</span> to add a blank item to 
  the list, and enter the selector text. To remove a selector select an item in 
  the list and click <span class="command">Remove.</span></p>
<h2>Editing selectors</h2>
<p>To modify style selectors, you have to edit them in place, using commas to 
  separated the selectors. You can also cut, copy and paste text, to change the 
  order of selectors, or add them to another theme.</p>
