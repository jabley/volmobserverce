<h1>Setting style properties</h1>


  
<p>In the tree view below the Selector list you can choose one of the categories 
  or sub-categories of style properties, and set the related properties. You can 
  select only one category at a time. When you choose a category, the edit controls 
  are enabled. The available controls depend on your selection.</p>
<p>Some properties have a <span class="command">Browse</span> button that opens 
  a selection dialog, such a font or component list, where you can choose values. 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a category in the tree.</li>
  <li>Choose properties from the drop-down or dialog.</li>
</ol>
<p>The properties are added to the selector.</p>
<h2>Importance and inheritance</h2>
<p>All the properties in a category have a button that you can toggle to set or 
  unset the CSS '!Important' value for the property. When you set the value, the button displays an explanation point icon. When you unset the value, the button is blank.</p>
<p>Drop-down lists always contain the value 'Inherit' as one of the options. 'Inherit' 
  means that the value of this property will be inherited automatically for the 
  containing XML element.</p>
<p>You can also set these values for all the properties in a category.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Select a category in the tree.</li>
  <li>Right click and choose <span class="command">Set All to !Important</span> 
    or <span class="command">Set All to Inherit</span>.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Multiple values</h2>
<p>Some CSS properties can be set with 'shorthand' values. For example, although 
  you can set the border width properties of a table individually, it is also 
  possible to set all four width values with the single shorthand statement, <span class="code">border-width: 
  1px;</span>. In these cases MCS uses a single category, and displays an <span class="uicontrol">All</span> 
  control where you can set the value, as well as the individual properties.</p>
<p>Other controls combine pairs of properties, for example horizontal and vertical 
  positions. If you set one value in a pair to 'Inherit' MCS sets the other value 
  to 'Inherit' as well.</p>
<p>Another combination is where you need to set a numeric value and the unit of 
  measurement, for example, an amount for spacing and the unit as '50 pixels'. 
  In these cases MCS displays two drop-downs.</p>
