<h1>Style rules</h1>
<p>Each theme in MCS corresponds to a Cascading Style Sheet (CSS). Each style 
  rule is identified by a selector, and has a set of properties.</p>
<h2>Selectors</h2>
<p>A selector refers to one or more XML elements in the content of your web pages. 
  So you might have a rule for each level of heading, another for paragraphs, 
  another for tables,and so on. You can use multiple selectors to apply a set 
  of style properties to several elements. For example, you could assign the Arial 
  font family to all your headings.</p>
<p>In addition you can create more specific selectors for classes of element, 
  or elements with individual identifiers, using the <span class="code">class</span> 
  or <span class="code">id</span> attributes. An example is giving a paragraph 
  a 'note' class that adds a colored background and a border.</p>
<p>The CSS specification also provides for pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes 
  like hyperlinks, with different states for 'hover' and 'visited', and you can 
  specify these in MCS too,</p>
<h2>Properties</h2>
<p>Style properties include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>font families, and their weight and color</li>
  <li>borders with their style and width</li>
  <li>lists with their numbering options</li>
  <li>table cells and their padding and background color</li>
</ul>
<p>to name just a few.</p>
<h2>External stylesheet</h2>
<p>As an alternative to specifying styles in the Theme editor, you can define 
  an external CSS stylesheet on the Overview page.</p>
