      <h1>About MPS</h1>
      
      <p>Multi-Channel Server (MCS) enables content to be adapted for
         presentation on any web-enabled device. It is tailored to
         pull, or browser-based content delivery. Multi-media
         Messaging Services (MMS) technology has created a need for
         device awareness to be used in a push-based context, by
         rendering rich media messages in a device-specific way.</p>
      
      <p>Message Preparation Server (MPS) satisfies this need. It
         builds on the core functionality of MCS to allow the
         optimization of message-based or WAP push content. It
         provides the ability to write applications to generate and
         transmit messages to subscribersâ€™ devices. This allows
         applications to be created that can support mass distribution
         of messages to provide significant end user function. The
         messages might, for example, contain information that users
         had subscribed to.</p>
      
      <p>MPS allows multimedia messages to be authored using the same
         techniques used to create MCS content for online delivery.
         This means that JSP pages or XDIME documents, combined with
         MCS policies, can be used to create rich message content. MCS
         supports MPS in enabling message content to be rendered in a
         way that is optimized according to the capabilities of the
         target device.</p>
      
      <p>MMS, HTML-formatted email (MHTML) and SMS message output are
         supported. Only the first two message types may contain rich
         media content. WAP push URLs are sent as SMS messages.</p>
         
      <p>A Message Preparation Services API
            (MPSAPI) provides a programming interface for developing MPS applications.</p>
