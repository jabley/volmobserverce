      <h1>Deployment and performance</h1>
        
        
        
            
      <h2>Deployment options</h2>
            
      <p>By default ICS is installed into a default directory,
                allowing you to configure the settings to your
                requirements before deploying.</p>
            
      <p>You may wish to install ICS on a standalone server that
                is separate from the MCS instance because the
                transcoding workload is very CPU-intensive. To run ICS
                as a stand-alone application you should rename the
                <span class="filepath">ics-web.xml</span> file to
                <span class="filepath">web.xml</span>. If ICS is to be run with
                another application, then you should copy the
                <span class="code">servlet</span> element and all its content
                from <span class="filepath">ics-web.xml</span> into the
                <span class="filepath">web.xml</span> file where the other
                application is installed.</p>
            
      <pre class="code">&lt;servlet&gt;
   &lt;servlet-name&gt;ICS&lt;/servlet-name&gt;
   &lt;servlet-class&gt;com.volantis.transcoder.Server&lt;/servlet-class&gt;
   &lt;init-param&gt;
      &lt;param-name&gt;config.file&lt;/param-name&gt;
      &lt;param-value&gt;[path]\MCS\ics\webapps\ics\WEB-INF\ics-config.xml
      &lt;/param-value&gt;
   &lt;/init-param&gt;
&lt;/servlet&gt; </pre>
            
      <p>If the server is to run in a clustered environment, you
                should ensure that the <span class="filepath">ics-config.xml
                </span>file can be accessed from all servers by
                entering the correct path in the
                <span class="code">param-value</span> element.</p>
        
        
            
      <h2>Accelerated performance</h2>
            
      <p>The ICS installer includes the Java Advanced Imaging
                (JAI) core libraries
                <span class="filepath">jai_codec.jar</span> and
                <span class="filepath">jai_core.jar</span>, located in
                <span class="filepath">ics/webapps/ics/WEB-INF/lib</span>.
                These libraries provide all the basic image
                transcoding functions, but are less performant than
                native language acceleration libraries that are
                available for some platforms. If a native
                implementation is present, JAI will choose it for any
                available function.</p>
            
      <p>To improve transcoding you can download the native
                language libraries for your platform from <em>Java Advance Imaging API</em>.</p>
            
      <p>If MCS is deployed on an platform for which JAI native
                acceleration libraries are not available, it may be
                advisable to host ICS on a platform that can support
                these libraries.</p>
