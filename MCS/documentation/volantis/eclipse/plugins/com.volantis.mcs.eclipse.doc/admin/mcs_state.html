			<p>MCS maintains state in memory in the case of fragments and
				external CSS stylesheets, and in sessions in the case of forms.
				MCS therefore requires that 'sticky' sessions are enabled if it is to work correctly in a multiple-machine environment.</p>
			<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Session information is not serialised, so it will
				not be moved from one machine to another, even if the
				application server can do that automatically.</div>
			<h2>Fragmentation / Dissection</h2>
			<p>Information about which fragments from which layouts are active,
				as well as which shard from each visible pane is visible, is
				retained in memory. The state is selected by a request
				parameter. The mapping from the parameter value to the state is
				generated on demand, so the same parameter value is likely to
				map to different state on different machines. This means that
				fragment links for a page must be sent back to the machine that
				produced the page; otherwise the resulting page will not contain
				the correct set of fragments.</p>
		
		
			<h2>Forms</h2>
			<p>Form specific state is needed in order to fix up differences
				between how different markup languages (mainly HTML and WML but
				also VDXML) submit the values for the same type of field. This
				normalization of request parameters is performed automatically
				by MCS, and the normalized parameters are available through
				methods on the <span class="code">MarinerRequestContext</span>. MCS retains the state in session of values
				which were provided in the form, but which is not passed to the
				page that handles the form.</p>
			<p>Failing to send the form submission back to the same machine that
				generated the form may cause corruption of the parameters.</p>
			<p>The HTML / WML issues are as follows.</p>
			<p><span class="code">xfaction</span> and <span class="code">xf:submit</span>:
				HTML uses the value of an
					<span class="code">&lt;input type="submit"</span> as the
				caption to display. As captions can be translated it could vary
				from one user to another but the page that processes the form
				submission should not have to deal with the translated captions
				so MCS does it automatically. WML does not have this problem as
				the generated markup explicitly submits the value of the action,
				not the caption/label.</p>
			<p/>
			<p><span class="code">xfmuselect</span> and <span class="code">xf:select</span>:
				WML submits multiple values using a single request parameter, and
				separates each value with a ';'. HTML on the other hand submits it
				as separate instances of the same parameter. MCS automatically
				converts the multiple value WML parameter into the HTML format
				but in order to do that it needs to know the type of the
			field.</p>
		

		
			<h2>Form Fragmentation</h2>
			<p>A fragmented form is represented as multiple forms to the target
				device. The submitted values must be collated, so that when
				the form has been completed, they can be passed to the processing
				page as a complete set. Also, as HTML does not allow multiple
				targets for submitting a single form it is necessary for all the
				form submissions to be dispatched to a servlet that will then
				redirect the request to either the source page to generate the
				next/previous fragment, or the processing page to handle the
				whole form. This information is retained in session.</p>
			<p>Failing to send the form fragment submissions back to the same
				machine that generated the form fragments may cause corruption
				of the parameters and/or incorrect navigation.</p>
		


		
			<h2>External CSS</h2>
			<p>MCS generates optimized CSS for each page, and ideally this
				should be provided as part of the page. However, some devices do
				not support internal CSS, or have restrictive limits on the size
				of the internal CSS. So they need to be stored externally to the
				page and referenced using a URL. This CSS is stored in memory
				and accessed using a secure key to prevent clashes.</p>

			<p>Failing to send the request for the external CSS back to the same
				machine that generated the referencing page will usually cause
				no styling to be visible.</p>
