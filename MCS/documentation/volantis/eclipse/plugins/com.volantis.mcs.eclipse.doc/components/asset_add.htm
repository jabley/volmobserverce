<h1>Adding an asset</h1>
<p>You can add assets to image components in the New Component wizard, or with 
  the Image component editor. With other component types, you can only add assets 
  by using one of the component editors.</p>
<p class="taskhead">To open an editor:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Right-click on a component in the policy tree and and choose <span class="command">Open 
    with</span></li>
  <li>Now choose the MCS editor for the component</li>
</ol>
<p>You can also double-click on the component in the policy tree.</p>
<p>The contents of the Asset Attributes section of an editor depends on the type of component you select. For a complete list of asset attribute values see <a href="asset_attributes.htm" title="Asset attributes">Asset attributes</a>.</p>
<p class="taskhead">To add an asset:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Add</span> to add a new asset. An icon is added to the list, and the edit controls are enabled. </li>
  <li>Now you can enter a value and other asset attributes. As you add information in the controls, it is appended to the text in the asset list. In some cases you can use a <span class="command">Browse</span> button or a drop-down to make a selection.</li>
  <li>If there is a <span class="uicontrol">Value type</span> drop-down, you can select an type from those available.</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: When you browse to add an image asset, 
  MCS can determine certain attributes automatically, for example the filename 
  that is inserted in the <span class="uicontrol">Value</span> attribute. However, 
  MCS does not record the full path to the asset you have selected.<br>
  <br>
  You can add only <em>one</em> convertible image assest to an image component. 
  If you attempt to add more than one, you'll see an error meassage.<br>
  <br>
  With <em>all</em> assets, you need to use asset group URLs to locate the files 
  on a server or device, and use the <span class="uicontrol">Asset Group</span> 
  control to associate this URL with the asset.</p>
