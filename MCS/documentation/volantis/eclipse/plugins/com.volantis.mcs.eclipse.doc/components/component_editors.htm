<h1>Component editors</h1>
  
<p>There is a component editor for each component type. There are some differences 
  related to the component type, but they share several features.</p>
<p>All the editors have controls grouped in the following sections.</p>
<h2>Attributes</h2>
<p>Each editor contains a section defining the attributes of the component. In 
  some cases these are fallback component names to which the current resource 
  refers. For example, a dynamic visual component has four possible fallback types. 
  In other cases such as button and rollover image components, they are references 
  to the actual image components used.</p>
<h2>Assets</h2>
<p>Any assets that you have added to a component are listed in the Assets section. 
  You can add and remove assets at any time. Some components support multiple 
  assets, while others, such as charts, allow only a single asset reference.</p>
<p>Common to all Asset sections are buttons to <span class="command">Add</span> 
  or <span class="command">Delete</span> assets, and an assets list. The Asset 
  section for an image component also has a <span class="command">Browse</span> 
  button. When you add image assets, you can browse to a directory and filter 
  for a file type, and in some cases see a preview of the image. MCS also obtains 
  some image asset attributes from the file system.</p>
<p>Asset icons in the list are like the icons in the policy tree, with a blue 
  lozenge decoration. When you select an asset in the list, the attributes section 
  of the the editor is enabled, and you can edit the attribute values. You can 
  also choose multiple assets and apply attribute values to each item in the selection.</p>
<h2>Asset value and value type</h2>
<p>All assets have a value, which is the filename. Script and text assets additionally 
  have a value type that you can select from a drop-down.</p>
<h2>Asset type</h2>
<p>Some assets have types that are listed in a drop-down. The lists are constrained 
  to the allowed types in each case. For example an text asset has the types: 
  Plain, Volantis Markup, XML Markup, Voice XML Help and so on.</p>
<h2>Asset attributes</h2>
<p>The attributes of an asset depend on the type of asset. You can use the <span class="command">Browse</span> 
  button select an asset group name from a policy tree view. Where a device attribute 
  is appropriate, you can navigate a device type view to make your selection.</p>
