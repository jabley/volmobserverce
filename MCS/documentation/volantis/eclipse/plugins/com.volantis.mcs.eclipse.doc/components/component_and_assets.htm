<h1>Components and assets<img src="../images/asset_group_banner.gif" width="75" height="58" align="left" alt="Asset group icon"></h1>
<p> MCS allows you to separate content and presentation by providing device-independent 
  elements for use in layouts. However, some resources are highly device-specific. 
  Images are a good example. The size, color, rendering and even the type of an 
  image may need to vary for different devices. Mobile phones, for example, can 
  require special image formats.</p>
<p>MCS manages the relationship between device-independent content and device-dependent 
  data by using components and assets.</p>
<p>For example, an image component can refer to to a set of image files, or assets, 
  that individually fit the profiles of several different devices. The attributes 
  of each asset are contained in the component. In a web page, the <span class="code">img</span> 
  element in the XDIME markup contains the name of the Image component in it's 
  <span class="code">src</span> attribute. When a device requests the page, MCS 
  uses the image attributes to select the best image asset to display on the device.</p>
<h2>Creating and editing components</h2>
<p>In MCS, you use the New Component wizard to name components in your project, locate them, and define attributes or fallback values that refer to other components.</p>
<p>You use one of the MCS component editors to add assets to a component and define the asset attributes.</p>
