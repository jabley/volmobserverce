<h1>Types of variant</h1>
<p>MCS defines different variant types that are used in components in different 
  combinations.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device specific</li>
  <li>Convertible</li>
  <li>Generic</li>
  <li>Null</li>
</ul>
<p>MCS uses the variant type to locate variants that are the best match for the 
  device in use. The type also determines which of the values in the metadata 
  of the Component editor section are required, and therefore the error messages 
  that you may see. </p>
<h2>Device specific variants</h2>
<p>Most component variants are device specific. They can be targeted at a particular 
  device or device family. Text variants are an example of a targeted variant.</p>
<p>MCS searches the repository for a variant which is targeted at the device currently 
  in use. If there is no exact match, MCS searches for variants that match the 
  parent of the current device in the device tree. This search continues up the 
  hierarchy until either a variant is found, or MCS reaches the root of the device 
  tree. </p>
<h2>Convertible variants</h2>
<p>Image variants may be treated as convertible variants. MCS routes the image 
  through the Image Conversion Service (ICS), changing the file format and scaling 
  it to fit the device in use. </p>
<h2>Generic variants</h2>
<p>Generic audio and image variants cater for variants that are not targeted, 
  where the task of identifying images for particular devices at design time is 
  very time consuming. MCS searches for a variant with properties that make it 
  suitable. For audio variants, for example, the decision is based on how the 
  audio data is encoded. With images, encoding, pixel depth, rendering and image 
  size are all used. </p>
<h2>Null assets</h2>
<p>Using a null asset value means that MCS will not search for variants matching 
  other devices in the device hierarchy. It behaves as if no variant exists for 
  this device </p>
<p>For example, setting an image variant for a PC device to 'Null' will prevent 
  that image being used as fallback for a specific browser. </p>
<div class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you define a device specific or null 
  type for a device, no other variants in the component may be targeted at that 
  device. If another device specific or null asset has the same target, you will 
  see an error message. </div>
