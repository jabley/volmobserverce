<h1>Adding a component</h1>
<p>In MCS, you can use the New Component wizard to create project components. 
  The wizard allows you to define:</p>
<ul>
  <li> A component name and its location in your project folders</li>
  <li>Attributes or references to existing project components</li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>Choose a <a href="../mcs/mcs_choose_wizard.htm" title="Choose a New Component wizard">New 
    Component wizard</a></li>
  <li>Select MCS in the tree and then choose one of the component types</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Naming a component</h2>
<p>On the first page, you can locate and name the component. Each component is 
  a file in your project. The policy tree view will be synchronized with your 
  current project folder selection.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Choose the policy source directory in the tree view</li>
  <li>Enter the component name</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Next</span></li>
</ol>
<h2>Defining component attributes</h2>
<p>On the next page you can enter values for the component attributes. These are 
  references to other existing components. The number of references will vary 
  with the type of component you have created. For example an image component 
  has two fallback references for image and text, while a dynamic visual component 
  four fallbacks.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the <span class="command">Browse</span> button to display the Component 
    Selection dialog and locate a component in your project. This view is filtered 
    for the component type you need to select.</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard. The component 
    icon is added to the project folder and the component editor is displayed 
    in a new tab.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Selecting component assets</h2>
<p>If you are adding an Image component, you can choose one or more image assets 
  on the next page.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Use the <span class="command">Browse</span> button to locate the root folder 
    for your project assets, and expand the directory tree to find an asset</li>
  <li>Choose a file type to filter for the asset type you want to select. The 
    wizard displays a preview if it is available.</li>
  <li>Check the checkbox next to the filename to select it</li>
  <li>Click <span class="command">Finish</span> to close the wizard</li>
</ol>
<p class="note"><strong>Tip</strong>: To select all the files in a folder and 
  its sub folders, check the box next to the folder name or click <span class="command">Select 
  all</span>. <span class="command">Deselect all</span> deselects all the files 
  and folders.</p>
