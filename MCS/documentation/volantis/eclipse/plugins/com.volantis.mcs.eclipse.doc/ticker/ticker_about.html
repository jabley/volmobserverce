      <p>The BuzzCast Client is a collection of widgets that can be used to build a "home screen" or "idle
         screen" application for mobile handsets, particularly smart phones. The BuzzCast Client receives
         content items from a personalized feed for the subscriber. Subscriptions are configured and managed
         by the BuzzCast Server. Titles, headlines, summaries, images from content items are displayed to the
         mobile user in a variety of visually appealing ways, on a rotating basis. The mobile user can select
         any item to see its details. Some of the additional elements, such as item description, will already
         be on the device allowing instant access. The full content will be located on the server, accessible
         seamlessly via an on-line browser session which takes place within the same client.</p>
      
         <h2>BuzzCast Server</h2>
         <p>BuzzCast Client application requires access to BuzzCast Server. Server side of the BuzzCast
            service is responsible for managing and delivering feeds, channels, and bundles to the client.</p>
