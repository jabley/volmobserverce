The keystores and verts in the directory are for use
with the updateclient and updateserver, against
the name of update.volantis.com these will need to
correct when we got to volantis.net. I have
also placed a copy of the cert and keystore for the
client in the com/volantis/mcs/gui/updateclient/
directory to be shipped with the updateclient.
